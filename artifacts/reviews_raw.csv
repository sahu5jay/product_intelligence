"This spray is really nice. It smells really good, goes on really fine, and does the trick. I will say it feels like you need a lot of it though to get the texture I want. I have a lot of hair, medium thickness. I am comparing to other brands with yucky chemicals so I'm gonna stick with this. Try it!",5
"This product does what I need it to do, I just wish it was odorless or had a soft coconut smell. Having my head smell like an orange coffee is offputting. (granted, I did know the smell was described but I was hoping it would be light)",4
"Smells good, feels great!",5
Felt synthetic,1
Love it,5
The polish was quiet thick and did not apply smoothly. I let dry overnight before adding a second coat since it was so thick.,4
"Great for many tasks.  I purchased these for makeup removal.  No makeup on your washcloths.  Disposable, so great for travel.  Soft.  Absorbant.",5
These were lightweight and soft but much too small for my liking. I would have preferred two of these together to make one loc. For that reason I will not be repurchasing.,3
This is perfect for my between salon visits. I have been using this now twice a week for over a month and I absolutely love it! My skin looks amazing and feels super smooth and silky. This is also super easy to use (just follow instructions). I can see already that I will begin expanding the time between visits which will definitely help me save money in the long run. Highly recommend!,5
"I get Keratin treatments at the salon at least 3-4 times a year (would do it more often if I could afford it). I am always in the market to use products that can help extend my salon visits. This Keratin shampoo is really nice. It is sulfate free (which is the first thing I look for ) and makes my hair feel silky smooth and soft. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to improve the texture and appearance of your hair. I really like the fragrance, too.",5
"I was very disappointed when I got this facial scrub. I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges). I won't be repurchasing.",3
"This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin. My skin feels amazingly softer and smoother and allows for a nice base for my makeup to be applied over. You only need a small pea sized amount to cover your entire face and neck. Highly recommend for all skin types, ages and for women as well as men.",5
"I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. So, when I saw this I was excited to try it. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.",3
"Really nice small brush. Made well, nice wood made with boar bristle, my son absolutely loves this. It brushes his hair well and keeps him looking his best. This compact size makes it nice to keep in the center console of his car or to take on vacation with him. Highly recommend!",5
"I had never tried anything for my skin consisting of pomegranate, so I was anxious to try this. It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers. I actually was quite surprised how well this worked from start to finish. It was nice having an entire skin care routine in one package (instead of me working with various separate products. Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner. It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month. Highly recommend!",5
"When I saw this, I was thrilled to be able to try it. I have suffered from bags and dark circles under my eyes for years now. I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.",3
"This is a great hair straightener. Heats up quickly and evenly, makes it easy to take the curl out of my naturally wavy hair. It fits easily in my hand and maneuvers around the front and back of my head easily. Does not heat up my countertop (keeps the heat on the iron). I love this pink, too, it matches my decor perfectly. I highly recommend this Bellezza styler.",5
"I really like these ear swabs. First they come in a large, handy box and are easy to store (will last a long time). Second, they are all organic and good for the environment. Third, they are strong and don't fall apart very easily. I highly recommend these over Q-Tips (which I have used for years).",5
"To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.",5
"At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!",5
"This a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.",5
"I love this combo package, particularly the flosser. This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!",5
"I don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.",3
So many great diverse colors,5
"Got my new eyebrows in mail today.  Magically my baby caterpillars grew into gorgeous mama size ones.  Papa caterpillar loved the look.  And the eyebrow pen, tweezers and brow shaper templates were just an extra nice bonus!  Thank you.",5
i had a small one  that just got destroyed  these wires are much longer and bigger  i expect to live a lot longer than the tiny one i had !,5
its OK  not as good as the  original Wet Brush  just a knock off,3
nothing special  unfortunately i waited too long to return them ....  no results at all  dont waste your money,1
I love the cocoa butter and shea butter. I hear the shea butter up and whip it until it softens.,5
"I think I need to stick with my 5 blade razor. This razor is not only difficult to hold & is made of a hard slick plastic with no grippers, but doesn't shave as well as my 5 blade razor. The style is nice, but the functionality is not.",2
A total waste of money.  I get better results using a tea bag to alleviate under eye swelling.,2
"Didn’t expect much but got a nice beautiful surprise! These are nothing short of awesome. Stay on your head - no matter how big your noggin is or how much crazy hair you have. I need to buy more - my daughters have taken all!! The price, quantity and quality is nothing short of “ best deal ever”!!!!",5
"This halo hair extension is simply put, garbage.  Now, you get what you pay for.  And this is a very cheap version.  The faux hair is very shiny and looks literally like bad barbie hair.  It looks WAY better in the photos than in real life.  The color is horrific, in my opinion of course.  The streaks are like paint strips.  And all of that would be one thing - but the worst is that the hair completely fell out!  I had hand fulls of hair strands just trying to put the halo on!  And you might think - well, maybe a little loss is to be expected?  Except this was handfuls and handfuls.  I literally dropped the whole thing right into the trash.  I would say this one is a pass for hair loss alone.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,000 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including well over 25,000 likes. Bottom line, I pay for all my stuff, just like you do.",1
"I purchased these to see if I could set my mom's hair.  She has fine, thin, short hair and I think these could be fun once in a while for a fluffy set.  Mom is 81.  These are super old school - hoping I can do it with a little foam styling product.",5
I purchased the tool for my 80 year old mom because she like to file her own toes and fingers.  This tool makes it so she can.  The thing I don't like?  That you have to purchase ALL four files - the buffing files (2 of the 4) are useless.  So - it would be nice to be able just to purchase the green and blue ones.  The buffing files just go into the trash.,3
I'm a BIG wet nap fan.  Always have been.  They smell good.  They are just the right size.  I carry them every where.  They don't leak like a bottle of hand santizer and fit in any pocket.  1000?  Yeah.  It's alot...but I'm happy to use them freely.  And quit looking for ways to pocket them at a restaurant.  :)  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good shape!,5
"Rrain hats are really handy when<br />one doesn't have an umbrella, and<br />easy to carry in a purse or pocket.",5
"Worked out fine.  Just a bit tight, but o.k.",4
Works very well,5
Normally I like NYX products but not this one. It leaves a funny coating on your eyebrows and pushes them down so much they look thinner than they are.<br />Not worth it.,1
These fall apart easily...I would not buy again,2
These are nice and fit well and the masks loop in the right place to stay on your face,4
These are not what I was expecting. They are super nice quality and can almost be used as ear warmers. Vey thick and plush.  I ordered 3. One for my grand daughter and on for each of my nieces. They love them.,5
"Very natural, light weight and good quality. I use on brides who are not use to lashes but still want a bit of length and definition.",5
I bought a pack of these and loved themso much I immediately bought another pack. They are perfect all around and the price is great!,5
Haven’t worn it very long yet so can’t comment on longevity but looks great and dried pretty fast.,5
Plastic does not bend for matching your brows and will not lay against your skin for tinting at all. The shapes included are way too large and do not match the natural brow lines. Total waste of money.,1
Adorable and hold up just fine,5
"Loved it. The words worked out fine but the single pins broke right out of the package, so I threw them out, but I didn’t buy these for the single pins.",4
Be careful there are 3 similar looking packets in the box. 2 are peels and 1 is a moisture mask.,3
Great multi pack of bands for a great price. They wash well in the laundry and don't lose any elasticity,5
"I'm loving this!<br />I've been looking for a great serum for fine lines and have tried many. However my skin can be very sensitive so with many that I've tried, I've found that I wake up with puffier than usual eyes and some have even caused significant flaky dryness. Not this one! Have used nightly for a few weeks now and absolutely no issues. Absorbs quickly, nor burning.",5
Easy to use,5
Use it for my everyday cologne,5
Wife gave them to a friend,5
Great product,5
"These diamond are absolutely beautiful and shine so well. Not cheesy like some of the colored diamonds can, does not look like cheap plastic at all.<br />I would definitely buy again.<br />Follow me on Instagram @theenailgame",5
sizing is all off,1
Super cute and great value!,5
This is rough on the skin.  I don't like it.  Not sure what it's supposed to do.,2
"This mask support works great.  It does what it's supposed to do. It keeps your mask off of your mouth and nose, allowing more airflow.  You mouth and nose are still covered, but the fabric isn't right up against your face.",4
my hair is long.  It took a long time to get these put in.  The curls were great. These rollers would be great for someone who wants to sleep in them. I didn't find it worth it to use during the day.<br /><br />Good curlers with no heat.  I prefer my hot rollers.,4
"I do like the angle of this dermaplaning blade, other than that, it's basically a razor.  It preforms just like any other razor blade other than the way you hold it.  I can't say it's something special due to this.  The cleaning brush is great and needs to be used since the hair stays in the blades.",4
"4 stars because it pulled my skin off on the sensitive crease on side of my nose.  Just be careful if you have a tough spot upon removing.  You must rewet it if it is sticking too strongly.  I started on that spot and didn't realize it was tearing my skin.  If you follow the instructions, you should have no problem.",4
I really love this blush it's super cute ultra kawaii and I personally am a fan of the changing pictures that it comes with so it's awesome I guess I just wished it was eyeshadow instead the sailor moon one is also cute but too expensive in my opinion and the blush is not a big deal but this item is more like collection stuff but it's really worth it if you want a cute gift or just something really cute to stare at :) /play with for a bit.,5
"This spray smells amazing, it does claim to be completely natural so I am wondering if it really is since the smell is very well... processed in my opinion, that being said, it does look completely natural it's completely transparent and once you apply it it doesn't feel as sticky as other products I've used before it really gives the hair a very natural look and for having just applied it a few minutes ago my hair feels extremely soft to the touch which gives me a pretty good idea that this is a good hair spray. The presentation is really pretty and looks cute and clean as well. I love it! I just hope it works well in the long run! The only problem I had (completely unrelated to the spray itself) is that they left it at my neighbors door instead.",5
Had originally planned on using this for my feet but given I have some cracks it mentioned not to use on cracked or hurt feet because it could sting and other similar side effects. I am not sure whether to use this product or not because it also mentioned that it is possible that it will sting whether or not you have cracks on your feet or anything similar. I am a little worried if I should use this at all. I am gifting this away because I do not want to hurt my feet. I hope it helps someone else.,4
"Very surprised! I am please with first round on my black, dyed hair. Turned a dark brown! Second round in a couple of days. (Suggest a leave in hair oil from scalp to roots for before and after use) hair is soft after use. Has an odor, but not overwhelming if you cover with disposable hair cap. Easy to use.",5
"This lip butter is pretty much a lip gloss. I haven't noticed any lip plumping action, but it is hydrating. It smells wonderful! There's a slight pinkish tinge to it, but it's sheer and not very prominent. It doesn't last very long and does transfer.",4
"I am enjoying this face cream. I find it to be luxurious. It's nice and creamy. The glass jar is very nice. It smells wonderful. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've been using it at nighttime because it is a heavier cream. I haven't noticed any miraculous results, but I am a regular user of anti-aging products, so I like to think that this is just continuing what's already going on.",5
"This is a good way to use a face oil. Normally I skip facial oils because I don't like the way they feel on my face. This one is mixed with a cream, so it doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or oily after applying it. It has a pleasant scent. It isn't sticky though it does leave behind a little tackiness, but that disappears quickly. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to do. I like it. It's definitely hydrating. I do think the descriptions are pretty vague. It doesn't bother my sensitive skin, which is always a plus.",4
"I'm in my mid-fifties and I have been using creams targeted to the neck and chest area for a few years now. I have definitely seem some improvement in the texture of that skin. This bottle is very small. It's a lotion consistency and it has a light pleasant scent. It doesn't leave my hands feeling sticky, but the bottle is sticky. I have washed it at least once and it remains sticky. It absorbs quickly. I can't tell if it's doing it's job as I haven't seen any noticeable changes, but it isn't hurting anything either.",4
"This night cream has a good, thick consistency. It's definitely a cream and not like a balm. It has a strong scent to it. It smells like a flowery perfume. It smells nice, but it is strong. If you are sensitive to smells, this may not be for you. I don't have any problems with it, though I do prefer citrus scents over flowers, but that's just a personal preference. It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It absorbs pretty well.",4
"I really like this face oil by Dose of Colors. It is fragrance free, but it has a light, pleasant smell to it. It does feel a bit oily, but that goes away after several minutes. I'm only using this at nighttime, because it's too heavy for daytime use in my opinion. It doesn't annoy my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling super soft!",5
"I enjoy sugar scrubs! They are wonderful for smoothing rough elbows. This one is a small container. I would consider it more of a travel size or sample size. It smells good. It's got a fruity/beachy smell to it. The scrub has a coarse texture which makes it better for exfoliating, yet I didn't have any troubles with it being too rough on my skin. It is very emollient and has a waxy feel to it.  Because of the waxiness, it coats the skin. I used some on my feet and they became a bit slippery on the tile shower floor. I have had some scrubs that leave you feeling super greasy and waxy, but this one is more of a moderate level of greasiness. It definitely softens the skin.",4
"This perfume by Shakira has a pleasant scent. I can detect sweet and spicy notes in it. It is not very strong, which is good. It definitely fades over the course of the day, but I can still detect light whiffs at the end of the day. The bottle is attractive, but the cap or lid is way too plain. You have the sexy body shaped bottle and then there's a little clear plastic lid that has not aesthetics at all. If you could be the lid to anything and doesn't stand out at all.",4
"I am in my early fifties. I have been using anti-aging products for the past several years. This eye cream has minimal smell to it. The consistency is a thin cream. It's not runny, it's just not thick. I have sensitive eyes and this is non-irritating. My eyes water a lot and that often leads to product getting into my eyes and causing stinging and or burning in the eye area. This cream has not bothered me at all. I haven't noticed any difference in the appearance of the skin around my eye, but because I am a regular user of similar products, I really wouldn't expect to see anything new or different. It does seem to hydrate the delicate skin area.",4
"I like wearing eye masks such as these. They are refreshing and energizing. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them, I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them, but when I went to the bathroom to remove them, they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.",4
"This is my first scrunchie. I have not had my hair cut in about 9 months because of the pandemic, so my hair has gotten longer than I've worn it in years! I'm in my early 50's and it's a little below my shoulders now. My hair is thick and coarse. It's long enough to wear in a messy bun for the first time in years! The scrunchie is easy to use and holds up my thick hair pretty well. I don't have to readjust it because it's falling. You can feel the coils inside the fabric. I find it fascinating how it works. When I take it off, it shrinks up again. I like it!",4
"I recently took the Pinrose fragrance quiz on their website and this was the scent that was recommended for me. It's okay. I don't dislike it. I definitely don't love it. It's a musky floral scent. Floral scented fragrances are not my favorites. I prefer either fruity or sweet. This supposedly has peach notes in it, but I don't detect them. Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes. They are fairly dry so you're not dripping in scent. I'm planning on putting some of these in my daughter's Christmas stocking. These are also great for travel!",4
"These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals are a fun way to try out a new scent! The box comes with 12 packets. Each packet has a fragrance infused towelette. They aren't too wet, but you are able to rub or wipe them on your pulse points or wherever and transfer the scent to your body. This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day. Since the box comes with so many, I plan to put some in my daughter's Christmas stocking so she can try them out. They would also be great for traveling.",4
"I have tried several different brands of face wipes. These have to be some of the best ones that I have ever used. They have a wonderful, refreshing scent to them. They are wetter than most wipes I have used which makes them more effective at cleansing the face. The cloths are a good size and pretty soft. They didn't irritate my sensitive skin. The package did rip as I was trying to remove the open sticker, so I have put them inside a plastic baggie so they don't dry out prematurely.",5
"I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.",4
"It's difficult to find some targeted skincare products in travel sizes. I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them. I do think the kit is a bit pricey, but that's not affecting my review.",4
"This set of gel nail polishes comes in a nice variety of colors. The brushes seem fairly comparable to other nail polishes. What I really like is that there is a little window on the front of each bottle that shows you the color. I've ordered some gel nail polishes that have no color identification on the bottle and I have had to paint (and tape over) a small dot of polish so I can identify them without opening. Overall, I am pleased with these.",4
"I work at home, so I can't get by without wearing a face mask for a good part of the day, but I do wear one if I am going out. I have had issues with some masks not staying over my ears. This is a good way to utilize those masks. The  headband is comfortable and light weight. It has some stretch to it. The buttons are a little loose, so I tightened them before I wore the headband out in public. I found that I had to pay attention to how I was putting it on my head so the buttons were even, otherwise my mask was crooked. It's definitely a helpful item.",4
"For a new (or at least new to me) brand of hand sanitizer, I am pleased with it. I like the pump dispenser which is easy to use. The bottles are a good size. While you can detect the smell of the alcohol, it's not too strong or overpowering like some can be.  With so many new brands out there these day, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.",4
"I am in my early fifties. I found a multi-step skincare routine a few years ago and I follow it pretty regularly. The final step for both the morning and evening is face oil. For the longest time, I skipped that step because I didn't want my face feeling oily. Plus, it just seemed that it would clog pores and lead to acne. I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft! I haven't had any problems since using it. I personally only use it at nighttime because I don't want my skin looking oily, even for a little while, during the day.",4
"This is a light weight serum. It has a runny, liquidy consistency that's non-greasy. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or tackiness. There is no scent to it either. It absorbs really fast and immediately hydrates your skin. It leaves a smooth finish. It's non-irritating and doesn't annoy my sensitive skin.",4
"I wear headbands like this in the evening when washing my face and following my skincare routine. These headbands are very soft. I found these to be a little small, but they do stretch enough to accommodate my large head. I have just had other headbands that were a little larger and didn't require being stretched to the max just to fit. I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.",4
"I guess I'm not the right target audience for this Vitamin C/Retinol Moisturizer. I'm in my early fifties. Both of those ingredients are part of my daily skincare routine, so I thought it would be perfect for me. I did not see the recommended for ages 20-30s before ordering. It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin. Other than that issue, I didn't have any other problems with my sensitive skin. Luckily, I have an eighteen year old daughter so I will pass it along to her to use.",3
"This serum is more the consistency of a lotion than serums that I have used in the past. It has a nice fruity smell. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The serum absorbs quickly and isn't tacky or sticky. I am in my early fifties and use an assortment of anti-aging products daily. I haven't seen any new miraculous results with this, but it does moisturize. As a regular user of such products, I really don't think I would see anything new from them, but rather a continuation of what I have already started to achieve.",4
"I apply body lotion every morning and night. This one is a thinner lotion than some, but it absorbs quickly. My skin just drinks it up! It's non-greasy and has a light, pleasant scent to it. The bottle is a little oddly shaped. It's thin and flat which makes it a little difficult to grip in my opinion.",4
"Last summer I decided to grow out my bangs after having them for all of my adult life. I hadn't used much hairspray since the eighties and into the nineties, but I found that I needed to spray my former bangs in order to help train them to their new position. This is a huge bottle of hair spray. It has a standard hair spray smell. It gives a nice mist. It doesn't leave my hair crunchy. It's a flexible hold so my hair moves and looks natural. So far I am pleased with it.",4
"As I have gotten older (I'm in my early fifties), I've noticed that my eyelashes have become sparser. This eyelash growth serum is easy to use. It doesn't sting or irritate my sensitive eyes either. I haven't seen much change in the length of my lashes yet, but I think I can see some new growth or density. I will continue using this and update my review if necessary.",4
"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate or annoy my skin at all. It has a pump dispenser that works nicely. It's thick, like a lotion consistency. The cleanser doesn't lather or foam. I haven't been able to notice any scent, good or bad. It doesn't dry out my skin. I'm very pleased with it.",5
"'Tis the season for dry hands! I go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is not too thick, but it's not runny either. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave behind any greasiness. It has a light, fruity scent that's not overpowering. In fact, I found it to be barely noticeable. It is very moisturizing and leaves my hands soft. I would order this again.",5
"I've used sonic toothbrushes before. I like the pink color of this. It comes with a travel case and extra brush heads. There are several different speeds/settings that you can use. As far as I can tell, there isn't a timer on it which would be nice. The bristles are pretty firm. I'm guessing maybe they are a medium. It does a good job of leaving my teeth clean.",4
"I am in my early 50's and have been a regular user of anti-aging products for the past several years. This serum comes in a glass bottle and has a dropper applicator. It takes about half of the dropper to cover my face. It has a tacky (but not sticky) feel to it which remains for a while even after it has absorbed into the skin. The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. There is a mild scent, but nothing that I could recognize. Overall, it's okay. I haven't noticed any tightening or improvements in my skin. However, as a regular user of anti-aging products, I wasn't expecting anything new.",3
"My husband started a business recently and was looking at options for his bookkeeping. He knew that he wanted to use QuickBooks from his previous experience. Originally he was going to use the web based version, but since this comes with a year of enhanced payroll, he decided to go with this. He consulted with an accountant in getting it set up for his company's needs. He did have to contact customer support to help him get the enhanced payroll feature working. For some reason, it had the number 1234567 prefilled and he couldn't change it without customer support. So far it has been easy to use and has done everything he's needed it to do.",4
"These hair towel wraps are the softest hair towels that I have ever had. They aren't the typical ""dry"" microfiber material that other hair towels tend to be.  My daughter hair goes past her shoulders a bit whereas mine is about chin length. They wraps work well for both of us. They stay in place well and take a lot of the water out of our wet hair. The towel doesn't get too heavy when wearing it either. I love the variety of colors. These really look nice and come in a gift box. They would make a great gift!",5
"I have been using jade rollers for the past few months. This is my third one. The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with. They both were in a nice drawstring bag and would be perfect for gift giving.",5
"I have one of the original Makeup Erasers and to be honest, I can't tell the difference between these cloths or the original one. Well, that's not entirely true, I can tell the difference. These have a hanging loop and the name brand ones don't! Side by side, they are identical. These are just as soft. They do an impressive job of removing makeup, especially mascara. They are gently on my skin. These come in a set of 2, plus the set is half the price of the original. I will be ordering some of these for the girls in my life!",5
"My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.",4
"I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a rich coffee scent that is perfect for slow moving mornings. It does leave behind an ever so slightly oily texture, but it goes away after toweling off and leaves behind soft skin. I haven't noticed any difference in my cellulite, but I have read that caffeine helps with it. I don't use it for the cellulite. I like to use it for exfoliating my skin.",5
"A few months ago I got a vanity mirror that magnifies 5 times. Until then, I didn't know that I had a blackhead problem. I don't always have blackheads, so I don't use this every morning. But when I do notice blackheads, I use this for a few days until they are gone. The product is white and has a very fine grit to it. The grit scrubs away the blackheads. It does not hurt or irritate my skin. It doesn't take a lot for each use so it should last a while.",5
"I am in my late 40's and started using anti-aging products a few years ago. Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning. I've had to stop using some of my favorite beauty products in the past for that problem. I'm very happy with this eye cream so far!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",5
"This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the “rubber pants” that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to “cut on the dotted line” but I couldn’t see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I’m a busy mom, so it’s hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",4
"My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",4
"I burned my back of my hand in a couple of spots this past fall and have been using FLAWless for a short period of time to see if it helps lesson the appearance of those burns. First of all, I would say it's more of a gel than a cream. It's a tan color and is easy to rub into the skin. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or residue. It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious. However, I am noticing that my freckles and age spots on the back of my hand are looking less noticeable and that's a welcome result. I am anxious to see what happens after continued use.<br /><br />*I  purchased this at a reduced price for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",4
"I am very happy with my Marrywindix acrylic organizer! I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great! Each drawer comes with a liner to keep things nice and neat.<br /><br />*I received my acrylic organizer from Marrywindix for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

"I am in my late 40's and always looking for new skin care products to help reduce the signs of aging, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this serum at a discounted price in order to try it out, I was more than happy to do so. It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin so you can continue your skin care routine. I'm a busy mom & don't have a lot of time to just wait around!  I love the list of natural ingredients!!! I've only been using this for a couple of weeks. I'm not seeing any major improvements with my wrinkles and such, but I am noticing an overall improvement in the texture of my skin. I realize that it often takes longer with continued use before some improvements are noticeable. I'm enjoying it & will update my review after continued use.",4
"I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don't use ear plugs very often, but it's nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don't have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.",5
"First of all, this is a generous amount of rosehip oil! I've been using it daily for about 2 weeks and I've barely put a dent in it. I've been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would have to get up & wash them. There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil. It's only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose. My scar is beginning to diminish. It's still there, but it has faded a little bit. I'm excited to see what happens after more use! The skin around my scar is super soft.  I may start using this to moisturize this winter.",5
Needs the charging cord included in the package instead of sold separately.,5
"only 2 problems with this product--expensive and hard to get.  Even if it is the best, I'm switching back to the Oster cleaner",5
Works very well,5
Love the colors,4
"The headbands with the bow on top is soft and so cute, I use the headband everyday when I put on a mask. The other spa headbands holds pretty well too especially when your hair gets in your way when you wash your face in the sink.",5
Perfect transaction by this seller. The products are awesome and I would definitely order this again. Great price as well..,5
The button locations are way off … but the quality of the headbands are great.,5
"cheap stuff... bumpy surface, paint is chipping off after one use. It's not worth printing a return label, or a drive to ups.",1
"I've worn this for 3 days, I'm a little disappointed the black paint had already started to chip off.",2
I'm very happy with my order. Will order item again. I use it for my nail art .,4
"My hairdresser recommended my husband get and use one of these for his thinning hair to use to stimulate the scalp when washing his hair. He also uses it with a rose water spray daily and within six months we have noticed a huge change in the thickness of his hair. I use mine too when I shampoo although I already have incredibly thick hair, and I too have noticed a difference. It also gives a nice lift at the roots too for any ladies with flat hair ( that is why my hairdresser uses them on herself).<br /><br />Great little pack of two. Almost like a his n' hers. Easy to use due to the grip and easy to pull apart and clean. Had ours a while now and still like new. Really great product and super price considering other places on the internet are selling these exact ones at $40 a piece! Pick up a bargain from Amazon.",5
"I'm not a big fan on the top but you could always just cover that with a beanie or a hat. But overall it's really nice looking, super soft, correct length and everything. would but again.",4
"At last, gluten-free deli bread! There are a few good gluten-free breads made without wheat, but they just don't have the flavor of this deli-style bread with sour dough in the ingredient list. This is the first on the market that I know of and it is delicious.There are 5 large deli size slices in a package. I find that a half slice for an open-face sandwich is just the right amount for me. For those of us in the gluten-free community, a deli-style bread is the bread most missed. This Schar bread is expensive but worth every penny! P.S. To follow up on this earlier review, Schar has reduced the size of the deli-style slices to about 2/3 of the original size, AND increased the price! I will still buy this bread, but with a heavy heart!",5
"I have been using Nutra Nail odor-free nail polish remover for well over a year. It is an amazing product, as it has an oil base that is non-drying to the nails. My local Publix is no longer carrying it and I was so thankful to have found it on Amazon. The ""cons"" are that the Amazon display shows two bottles of the product, which is what I expected to receive in my order. E-mail confirmation of my Amazon order is for 4 oz of product, a big disappointment! I hope that Amazon will correct the display so that customers are not expecting two bottles of Nutra Nail Odor-Free Nail Polish Remover!",5
This is super holographic. Love it. Also it dries fast. Obsessed with this color.,5
This is really really good. Best I’ve ever used by far.,5
"I read the description and thought this was something different than it was.  I DID get what I ordered, but it is damaged and the package is open, with paint leaking.  I think this happened prior to it being packed for my order because the packing seemed fine between shipper and me. Scared will have bacteria so not using.  Not what I'd hoped to get regardless but cute halloween makeup kit and I assume there are stencils in there somewhere.  I don't want to open it due to obvious paint leaking inside.  Don't trust manufacturing",1
"I use this everyday, love it!",5
Seems good but have been too nervous to test it out. Will update once I do.,5
This is a great lip gloss that feels very light on but also has a good amount of pigment to it. The shade I got is nice and neutral. It makes lips soft. It doesn’t last too long but expected with a more natural product.,5
Great shampoo and conditioner set. Smells great and leaves hair feeling clean and soft. I like this brand and have used it in the past. Seems to be great quality.,5
This is much faster and less messy than using the cream. Quick any easy. Not the longest hold but good for a few hours. Not much of any smell to it which is probably better. Some of these wax's are way too fragrant.,5
Great soap with mild natural scent. Works great on my sensitive skin. Leaves it soft and clean and doesn’t dry it out.,5
Great quality soap! So many good ingredients that are good for skin and hydrating not drying. Smells great and skin feels clean and soft after. Highly recommend.,5
These are so popular and I was excited to try but I don’t feel like it did it for me. It was hard to get down to my scalp and move around. Felt much easier to just use my fingers. Maybe I need to practice more of try a different massager. They seem well made though and look just like the picture.,4
Great hair wraps that help dry hair faster than a regular towel. I like the different colors and they seem to be great quality.,5
Tiny waver that works great to make smaller sized waves. Heats quickly and makes waves quickly. Only took a few minutes to do all of my daughters hair.  I only do a top layer of hair and around the face. Find that it looks less poofy this way. Seems well made and good quality.,5
Our girls love to play with this wig. Easy to put on and comes with a wig cap. Looks real.,5
"These look like nice tweezers, similar in look to tweezerman tweezers but for some reason they don’t grip hairs very well and are very annoying for me. They seem to match up perfectly at the end so not sure why they don’t grab well. Will use as backups or keep in purse or car.",3
Great set of oils that are great to use as is or when making other products. I used the coconut oil in a roller ball with some tea tree and clove oil for a rash and it works great. They are both have no scent.,5
Great set of hair items. Would make a nice gift. Works as described. The material is extremely plush and soft and feels luxurious to wear.,5
Decent shampoo. I used it alone without conditioner so I could see how it worked and it seemed to clean my hair well and leave it manageable. The scent is ok as well. While I didn’t notice anything negative there wasn’t anything that stood out to me to buy it again.,4
I have been wanting to try these food peels. I was nervous to try but after reading some of the other reviews I finally did and am glad I did. Followed directions and my feet started to peel the next day. No bad reactions or problems. I didn’t use the included tool. Soaking your feet each day helps with the peeling process.,5
"Great set of nail polishes. My daughter and granddaughter both liked them and thought they were great quality. Nice colors, go on smooth and dry quick. Don’t chip easily and Last as long as other quality polishes.",5
"Interesting sunscreen. Has a clear gel  consistency, goes and smooth and easily. Rubs in great and dries quickly, smells first of running alcohol and then berry. Seems to be effective in preventing sunburns.",4
"This is a nice cordless, travel size waterpik. It has good power for not being a regular waterpik. Some other cordless ones I’ve tried haven’t had the same power. This comes with a variety of tips. Is easy to fill and use. Has different settings and power levels. Charges via a usb cable.",4
Works well. Pain free. Easy to use. Requires 1 AA battery which is not included.,4
"From my daughter: I like that you can use this product in a variety of ways, when hair is wet as a leave in conditioner, when hair is dry to protect it from heat styling or after it is styled to add shine. I put some on my hair after I straightened it and it seemed to work well to tame frizz and add shine. It has a light scent that isn't overpowering.",4
"This flat iron works well to straighten hair, but I couldn't get it to curl very well like other straighteners I have. It is easy to use and the red light on the dial turns green when it is ready which is nice.",4
"Clippers work well. I prefer to use them without the plastic catcher that is attached, but it easily comes off. Nice travel case that includes a nail file. Clippers are very sharp and cut efficiently and smoothly.",4
"From my daughter: I usually buy Dove, Pantene or Tresemme shampoo. I haven't tried this particular tresemme before, but I really like it. It works great like the other varieties I have tried. This particular one smells like coconut, but not overly artificial or perfume-y. The shampoo works great, leaves hair clean, but not dried out and the conditioner works perfectly leaving hair soft and manageable but not greasy and weighed down.",5
Not greasy or filmy!<br />Love the look and feel of this lightweight moisturizer! Don’t use too much!<br />Skin feels amazing every morning when I wake up!,5
"I have been using this mascara for about 2 months now and I am in awe at the difference in my lashes. And I’ve used it all! I’ve tried so many types of mascara even went thru falsies, extensions. And I love this product. It lengthens, plumps, and makes my lashes LOOK healthier. I highly recommend!",5
"These along with their other scents (I love the blue ones too) are a must. I’m a face mask and product collector, I have so many masks but these are my top sheet masks for sure!!",5
Best stuff ever. My skin was so soft afterwards,5
I'm having a hard time but maybe it's me😏,3
Great for the price,5

OK at best.  The teeth bend and break in my pocket.  That never happened with previous Ace combs.  They're making them cheaper.,2
"I purchased this for my shoulder length hair. It's very difficult to use, would be best used on longer hair. It's a bit hard to wind the hair around this iron when it's my length.",3

Not as shiny as I was hoping but overalls I still love it!,5

Gift to a young Family member. They real like the item.,4
"I’m using this XXI vitamin C cream with the firming cream.<br />My face feels smoother, and not breaking out using both of them.<br />This cream is not real  thick, and absorbs well.<br />I use a little light make up and it goes on smooth over this, then use blush.<br /><br />I like this, but not noticing a major difference.<br />I’m a older women.",4
"The TRESemme’ Shampoo and Conditioner has a very nice scent to it.<br />Before using the shampoo shake the bottle..The shampoo is more like a gel, but did lather up.<br />The Conditioner left my hair shinny, and smooth..",4
Not good for getting out tangles,3
It is a nice grip for my clippers but the bottom slides around so what's the big idea!,3
"I bought one and after trying it, I bought three more so I would always have one handy.",5
"Very well made,good quality and very good color.",5
"Like other nail polish removers, this MOUNTAIN FALLS REGULAR NAIL POLISH REMOVER (for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce) is mostly acetone.  It smells like all the other nail polish removers that I’ve tried, and works like them, too.<br /><br />I use nail polish remover to take gummy stuff off my hands and other things.  If you use it this way, it’s important to remember that it can damage synthetic fabrics, wood finishes, and plastic.  Also, when using or storing it, remember that it’s highly flammable, and should NOT be used or stored near fire, flames, or heat.  (See my photo of the bottle label, with all the warnings.)<br /><br />The big 16-oz. bottle is equivalent to two of the regular-size bottles (e.g., [[ASIN:B004X8IFEI Sally Hansen Nail Polish Remover]]) that you find at local grocery and drug stores.",5
"This PHILIPS SONICARE ESSENCE+ TOOTHBRUSH & AIRFLOSS ELECTRIC FLOSSER (Value Bundle) is the real deal.  The sonic toothbrush gets your teeth cleaner than a manual toothbrush, because of the vibrating brush head and the 2-minute timer that tells you when you’ve brushed long enough.  A nice feature is that the color on the brush head bristles fades to let you know that the brush head is worn out and needs replacing.<br /><br />The electric flosser works really well--maybe not quite as well as string floss, but it’s definitely better than poking into gaps between teeth with a toothpick on a handle.  The flosser is good for cleaning under my bridge, which needs to be kept really clean to prevent gum irritation and swelling.",5
These are GREAT! Individually packaged in the box. Don't absorb product. Easy product application. Love them!,5
Have yet to notice any change have been using this product for awhile now,2
I received this gift set for Christmas. My husband ordered it from Amazon. The lip balm gets 5 stars! It’s my favorite. The lotion is such a strong offensive scent that I cannot wear it. I haven’t tried the little bottle yet since the lotion is so heavily scented.,2
"Whats all the hype about? Its no different than any other exfoliator i've tried.  The reviews sold me the product... Nice job<br />It's worth it, I though, experienced no Magic",3
Gift for vulnerable family members.<br />Gift was well received and appreciated.<br />Hopefully these will be used to minimize my loved ones risk of catching COVID19,3
Work and fit like the originals at MUCH less cost. I'm sold!,5
I bought this for a great nice for a gift and she loved it. Smell fantastic as well as moisturizing? Great price!,5
"The product was okay a little to thick to try and wear made my eyes feel uncomfortable a bit to heavy for my liking, l like them thick yet light and easy to apply these were a little difficult staying glued",3
I promised to retract the negative review once I received the product.  Thank you,3
I wish I loved this. This is a nicely packaged perfume in an attractive bottle with a gold-colored tassel hanging from the side. The scent is neither offensive nor enticing. I can't even describe what it smells like. It is so very subtle but it lasts a few hours.<br /><br />The current price of $44.99 ($49.99 minus $5) is competitively priced for perfume like this but it is not one I would order again as I have to really love it to pay that much.,3
"There are six silk scrunchies in this package in different basic colors. They are thin and slinky and are typical of what I expect of silk holders.<br /><br />These hold my hair well but as is expected of silk, can easily slide out. These are best on long hair because the potential to slide off is not as great. I personally prefer velvet scrunchies to these silk ones because they are ""beefier"" looking. However, for those who want the elegance of silk, then this delivers.<br /><br />The current price of $20.79 ($25.99 minus 20%) comes to $3.47 per band which is competitively priced for 100% Mulberry silk items like these.",4
"The photo on Amazon must be wrong. This cream is blue and not white. I hate colored creams. However, this goes on clear and was so super hydrating to my face, that I did not mark it down for the color. Note that the box it came in was all smashed and it was almost double the size of the jar. They could have fit almost two jars of this in the box. In addition, the cream in the jar looks half full.<br /><br />I love the results but not the packaging or the color or the jar being half full.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 for 1.69 fluid ounces is competitive. NOTE THE SIZING (.05 fluid ounces) SPECIFIED ON AMAZON is wrong too.",3
"The flip top cap has a tab on it that has to be pulled before dispensing this. The cream is very thick and reminds me of Elmer's glue. It is scentless and takes about 30 seconds to absorb. After that the skin is fully hydrated and protected. For the current price of $11.99, this is decent diaper rash cream.",4
"I love the tines on this long and short detangling comb.The only thing I do not like is the thin handle. I would have preferred a thick silicone handle so that I could get a better grip. The tines are strong and the spacing allows it to work very well BUT there are issues. <br /><br />I have three long-haired cats and unfortunately, my cats do no like this as it really pulls at their hair. Therefore, I have mixed feelings about this comb. On one hand, it detangles and gets out a lot of hair but on the other, my cats want to bite me when using it. I love how it works but not their response.",3
"This comes in a one gallon jug. There are two negatives to me. First, the biggest negative is that it takes work to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on tacky and takes a few minutes to absorb. Once absorbed, however, it is lightly moisturizing and it leaves my skin soft.<br /><br />This is vegan per the bottle and the lotion is scentless. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike. The current price of $54.99 for 128 ounces comes to $.43 per ounce, which is almost double the price of the lotion I love.",3
"I used this on my three long-haired cats and it picked up some hair. Since the surface area of the brush is small, there is not much hair that is picked up compared to other brushes. Also, I tried several of these types of brushes and this one is not as easy to clean as the others. The way this is supposed to work is to retract the bristles with the button and the hair that remains on top can be slid off. Since the tines do not retract fully on the top part of the brush, the hair does not slide off easily. Instead, I have to pick it off.<br /><br />Note that this is for long-haired pets only; I would not use this with a pet with short hair. I have three long-haired cats and even though this works some, I am not impressed for the two reasons I mentioned above. My favorite brush like this is [[ASIN:B09RH8FMMS this one]].<br /><br />The current price of $20.99 is outrageous for this as it is about $10 to $12 more than others of better or similar quality.",2
"This is a nice set of five individually wrapped pink-colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are of medium-density.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are of medium density, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy. I also love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These would have been perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer because each comes in their own package EXCEPT for the negative issue I mention below.<br /><br />There is one big negative, however. Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked. Therefore, I cannot recommend these if they are being used for resale or as stocking stuffers or Easter basket gifts because the price is actually more than it says on the package.",3
"This is a nice set. It contains a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside of both sides of the mirror is inspirational. It says ""Beautiful girl you can do amazing things.""<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very cheap make-up case all with the same inspirational verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice gift set. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is competitive.",4
"These bandages have many uses. There are 16 black rolls that are individually wrapped and each roll is 5 yards apiece and 2 inches tall. These self-adhere as the bandage is wrapped around a hand, leg, arm, etc. These stick well. The stretch allows this to be used like kinesiology tape with the exception that one cannot shower with this successfully and each wrap is for one-time use.<br /><br />The entire roll does not have to be used at once as it depends on the amount needed. When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected. However, this is perfect to use as a lightweight version of a carpal tunnel brace by wrapping it around a bad wrist, hand, and thumb. It does not stick to my skin nor to a pet's fur, which is wonderful.<br /><br />This is versatile enough to wrap around the handle of a tennis racquet to get a good grip or an umbrella or cane handle. There are just so many useful possibilities besides medical reasons.<br /><br />In summary, because the wraps are two inches wide and are not designed to stick to the skin, it does have a tendency to bunch up if wrapped around a knee or elbow, so it is not perfect for everything. I feel these are great bandages to have in one's medicine cabinet. At the current price of $15.19 ($15.99 minus 5%) it comes to $.95 cents per roll which is on the high side of competitively priced. These are self-adhesive bandages rebranded as tattoo grip tape.",5
"This is a nice set of 10 colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are dense.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are dense, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These are also perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />At the current price of $8.49 ($9.99 minus 15%) these are a reasonable $.85 per sponge.",5
"This is a lovely blender sponge. I love that this is dense because it does not absorb liquid foundation as some other less dense sponges I tried previously<br /><br />What attracted me to this the most are the angles.The two flat sides are great for smooth applications. The tip is great for more precision, such as around the eye. The round ends are good for blending or any large make-up application.<br /><br />This feels good to hold, blends well, and feels soft against my skin.  Also, the sponge does not smell.<br /><br />In summary, this blender makes a great gift for the make-up obsessed. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. The current price of $7.50 is on the pricey side. I tried other blenders of this quality that sell for less than half this price when purchased in a pack of three or more. For instance this [[ASIN:B08QCJ3DF7 set]] currently sells for $2.50 per sponge as there are 4 sponges for $9.99. Even though all the angles are not in one sponge, the functionality is still there and they are dense, which I like.",4
"[[VIDEOID:f77804a8088c40dfbef6fdcfacf8b15a]] There are three individually wrapped bath bombs in this set along with one bar of hand soap and a package of dried rose petals. In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.",3
"This is a work of art. It is absolutely gorgeous. It is also a bit heavy and it is fragile. The white flowers appear like they are made of clay. The design is lovely. However, I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and no matter what I do I cannot get this to stay. It immediately wants to fall out. I feel this is best applied by someone who is a stylist and perhaps can affix this with some pins. It is also probably best for someone who has thick long hair than someone with fine hair like me.<br /><br />I love this but am disappointed it does not work for me. Also, this can be used for any elegant occasion and not just by a bride. <br /><br />The current price of $19.99 is competitively priced for this. Note that I ordered the style called ""Silver 1."" However, what is pictured is a lot longer than what I received. Mine is more tightly compacted and half the size and there were no wires I could stretch out. I actually prefer the shorter version but the product shown really should be the one sent even though this is handmade. Therefore, my recommendation is to return the comb if you are not satisfied and if it is not close to the one pictured.",3
"This is a lovely set of two sponges but they are not heart shaped. What is heart shaped is the plastic holding the two sponges together with the flat side joining into what almost looks like a heart. Nevertheless, I still love them. The set comes with a great metal sponge holder. The sponges are dense. As a result, make-up does not soak in as easily.<br /><br />Both blenders have a flat side which is great for smooth applications. These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this with the exception that the sponges are on the dense side instead of airy. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too - at least to me. These colors also make it perfect for the Easter Basket.<br /><br />At the current price of $7.99 this comes to a pricey $2.66 per piece if I count the holder. Most other blenders sell for between $1.25 and $1.75 per piece in a set like this but without the heart-shaped packaging.",4
"This is a lovely set of three sponges in Easter colors of green, pink, and lilac. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder. The sponges are dense unlike most sponges like this on the market. As a result, make-up does not soak in as easily.<br /><br />The one lilac sponge with a flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (pink) and the hour-glass (green) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.<br /><br />These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this with the exception that the sponges are on the dense side instead of airy.

These colors also make it perfect for the Easter Basket.<br /><br />At the current price of $6.99 it is a reasonable $1.75 per piece if I count the holder.",5
I thought I would love this headband. It is gorgeous and feels great but the material it is made of is so slippery that it keeps sliding off my hair. It is only for this reason I rated this 2 stars as it is not for me.,2
"There is one recessed foundation brush in this set along with three blender sponges.<br /><br />The brush is not high quality. I love the unique container as the brush comes out of the tube the same way lipstick does. However, the container is thin and the bristles are only marginally soft and definitely feel synthetic and are shiny. However, there is no shedding. A brush like this is good for travel where it will be used sparingly.<br /><br />The star of this set are the three blender sponges. There are two sponges with a flat side which is great for smooth applications. The other sponge is a typical egg-shaped sponge that is good for blending or any large make-up application. These blenders feel good in the hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. They do have a slight smell to them but it is not offensive.<br /><br />The current price of $10.99 for 4 pieces comes to a pricey $2.75 per item. I love the sponges and to me they are five stars; however the brush is 2 stars to me. This brush only makes sense for travel or someone who wants a brush that remains covered and will not soil their other make-up applicators or bag. Note that the packaging is more than double the size of the products within. I can fit three sets of these in the box it came in.",3
"This is a nice room freshener. The fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses. The aroma does not last long--about 15 minutes. I happen to like fragrance, so I do like this linen spray.",4
"There are 9  soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. In fact it is over packaged. The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.",4
"There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, eye blending (fan brush), etc. In fact, there are more brushes than I needed. <br /><br />The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.<br /><br />The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also, the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.<br /><br />This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for; it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ",3
"There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.",4
"There are 12  supremely soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set with a silicone brush head cleanerbrush that doubles as a mini-brush holder. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />This is an attractive brush set in matte black. Unfortunately, the color of the silicone cleaner cannot be chosen. I thought I was going to get purple to match with my purple bathroom and I received a pink one.  <br /><br />The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel fantastic against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. The only thing to note is that because the bristles are super soft, these brushes are more suited for powder applications than cream or liquid.<br /><br />The current price of $19.99 is reasonable for this quality set as it comes to $1.67 per brush or $1.54 per item if counting the silicone cleaner.",5
"There are four typical no-frills extra large shower caps (red, tan, purple, and black). They fit me but have lots of room to spare. They are waterproof as the water just runs right off the exterior. There is an elasticized strap in the cap that can be adjusted. I adjusted one of them and it looked very lopsided on my head as a result of the adjustment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are not my favorite caps. They are too big and the adjustment throws the elastic out of whack. The current price of $11.99 comes to $4 per cap.",3
"This clip is gorgeous. If one looks at it quickly, it can easily be mistaken for a tarantula due to the black claws and sort of fuzzy looking applique.<br /><br />I have short to medium fine curly hair and my hair is long enough in the back to use this clip. It holds on to my hair well and looks great. The only negative is that a couple of the beads are loose on the applique. This not only makes noise (i.e. rattles) but creates a situation where they can accidentally be pulled off if the ""plastic"" thread holding it loosely hooks onto something.<br /><br />The current price of $11.99 is pricey for this but typical for a $1.50 clip that is all dressed up.",4
"There are four individually packaged 2.53 fluid ounce tubes of moisturizer in this set. They are all the same tubes. This moisturizer is lightweight and is mildly hydrating. It absorbs quickly and is a good product to use in the summer. I also like the fresh cucumber-like aroma.  I did, however, expect this to be more hydrating than it is. It is a decent cream but not excellent.<br /><br />The current price of $15.00 comes to a reasonably priced $3.75 per tube.",4
"The colors and design of these 12 headbands are super attractive. They are all double banded and most have a ""knot"" in the middle that can be worn in the center of the head or at the base of the neck. I personally do not like knots in my headbands but these are versatile enough to position the knot away from the forehead  without losing the good look of the band.<br /><br />The colors are great and there is a design for almost every outfit.<br /><br />Also, the current price of $18.99  comes to a reasonable $1.58 per band. These are definitely pretty and functional and they fit well. There was only one where the material was a hair looser on one side than the other for the top part of the double band. All the others were sewn perfectly.",4
"These headbands are made of PU leather with what appears to be a cloth covered plastic base. The headbands look good on and are best on those with a full head of hair since they are so large. The glue of the leather to the material was coming apart on one of mine, so the quality is so, so.<br /><br />However, it also came with two polyester-type cloth headbands, a bow hair tie, and a strip of cloth with avocados on them. None of the cloth bands fit me as they are kid-sized. Also, the material feels scratchy and horrible. The avocado tie is okay and so is the hair tie bow.<br /><br />The curent price of $12.99 ($18.99 minus $6) is too much for this ensemble.",3
"This bar of facial soap smells wonderful, lathers well, and feels great using EXCEPT the suds sting my eyes. Also, the bar size is like those hotel travel bars. At the current price of $8, that is absolutely insane. I would not expect to purchase this for more than $2 a bar and that is even expensive for this tiny size. In addition to the price, the fact that it stings if one accidentally gets suds in their eye is also a negative.",2
I love the results of this lotion. It is creamy and not too thin or thick and absorbs easily. I applied this to my face and neck and felt lightly hydrated. It does say there is a UVA/UVB sun filter in this but it does not say what SPF it is. The only other negative is that it took me about one minute to get the product to dispense from the pump bottle on initial use only. Also note the box is four times the width of the product. <br /><br />The current price of $38.40 is pricey for this but it's from France and expected.,4
"I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc. There are two large wands in this package. They are single-sided and have a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end that is good for washing my face with soap and water or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product. <br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the wand bends too easily. I would have preferred if the arm was a bit stiffer to make it easier to work with and allow me to apply more pressure.<br /><br />Overall, this set is excellent and about 7 inches long. It is soft on my skin, pliable, and long enough to hold on to. <br /><br />The current price of $9.90 comes to a competitively priced $4.95 per wand.",4
"At the current price of $48, this is insanely expensive. Yes the brush is a beautiful blue, with a fantastic gloss, and looks great, feels nice in my hands, and brushes my fine short to medium curly hair well. However, the brush stinks to high heaven and reminds me of the smell of burning rubber tires. Unfortunately, I cannot use this in this condition because I am extremely sensitive to offensive odors.",2
"This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of  pink, burgundy, and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder, a silicone brush cleaner, and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light and airy like most sponges like this on the market. <br /><br />The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.<br /><br />These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me. <br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.",4
"There is a lot of lotion (3.38 fluid ounces) for the $24 price tag. This lotion is creamy and very hydrating. It also absorbs quickly. Unfortunately, I am not at all crazy about the eucalyptus scent. If I loved the scent, this would have received 5 stars from me.<br /><br />BTW, this is good for a man or a woman despite what the title says.",3
"There are six blush-colored scrunchies and one white scrunchie. The material is a bit slick so there is a chance these will slip out of the hair. I have medium length hair in the back and they did slip out easily if I pulled on them. I do feel these are elegant and super attractive. If the bride and bridesmaids all have long hair, then these are a good option. I have no idea what these will be priced at but anything more than $10.50 (which would be 1.50 each) is too much.",3
"There are supposed to be six green and one white scrunchies but I received an additional white one to bring my total up to eight scrunchies. However, only seven are supposed to be shipped.<br /><br />These hair ties are dressy and nice. The scrunchie expands to hold a good amount of hair. Of course, when applying one of these, it is important to turn it so the tail goes down. That can sometimes be tricky.<br /><br />The only negative I see is that the seam shows the stitching as can be seen in my photo. They should have covered this with the area that is tied (meaning the area where the tail flows down). This is the only reason I took off one star.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 comes to $1.86 per scrunchie if one receives seven (and not eight) scrunchies.",4
"This comb is just beautiful and the quality is exceptional. It is also hefty. As a statement piece it gets 5 stars. However, I find it difficult to comb through my hair using this. I have short-to-medium-length fine curly hair and the tines are so thick on this, that it makes it difficult to pull the comb through my hair. If I had an easier time of it, this would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />The current price of $6.98 is reasonable for this.",3
"I love this shower cap. It is very attractive and the black and white colors just pop. I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and take a size small in a cap. This fits me perfectly and there is a little more room for more hair if I had it. This is comfortable and does keep my hair dry in the shower. Unfortunately, I hate the way the bow looks on me.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is on the high side of competitively priced.",4
There are two quality headbands in this set. The headbands are SUPER SOFT that I just want to feel them all day. They look great on and I love the design.<br /><br />I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and these work for me and are even better for someone with long hair. I actually put them over my ears so that they stay put. I have to do that with every headband I use.<br /><br />The current price of $3.99 is a reasonable $2 per band.,5
"This is a large oval brush that comes with a cinch pouch. The handle has a good grip due to the silicone ""sleeve."" <br /><br />The bristles are soft and feel great against my face. Initially, there were just a few bristles that fell out but that seems to have stabilized. I use brushes like these to apply blush. The brush head is quite large and usable only for larger jobs.<br /><br />The current price of $4.99 is excellent for this in my opinion and one of the reasons I rated this 5 stars instead of 4 stars.",5
"There are 10 brushes in total and a carry pouch. I really love these brushes. The geometric shape of the handles provide a good surface area for gripping each brush during application. The bristles are soft and they do not fall out of the brush. They feel great against my skin.<br /><br />Based on the Amazon site, these are the brushes in the set. Note that I cropped a photo of the brushes from the site and attached it to my review, so that one can see each brush's use.<br /><br />- powder brush<br />- blush brush<br />- angled contour brush<br />- foundation brush<br />- nasal shadow brush<br />- big eyeshadow brush<br />- small eyeshadow brush<br />- blending brush<br />- eyebrow brush<br />- lip brush<br /><br />In summary, I love that it has more smaller brushes than larger one because they are better for detail/precision applications. The current price of $15.19 ($18.99 minus 20%) comes to $1.27 per brush which I consider reasonable. I also love the color of these brushes as they match my pink bathroom.",5
"This set of two roll-on fragrances comes with a PU leather carry case that will hold up to six roll-on fragrances or essential oils. The lemongrass smells as it should and the protector blend smells spicy. Both of the fragrances are strong. The current price of $19.99 ($24.99 minus $5) is competitively priced for this set. Unfortunately, these scents are way too strong for me.",3
"I ordered the orange color. It is very pale and looks attractive in the tube. However, once worn it changed to a light pink on my lips. The moisturizing effects lasted a couple of hours but I personally did not like the look of the resulting color on my lips. Also, at the current price of $18.98, this is very expensive lip balm. Nivea makes colored lip balm that does not change color--so one knows what color they are getting. That lip balm works just as well and is a lot cheaper than this.",2
"I got the lavender and balsam fir set of soy candles. Each one comes in an 8 ounce tin. The balsam fir is headache producing to me and I hate it. However, the lavender is very nice and a faint lavender scent dissipates throughout my small kitchen when I am burning the candle.<br /><br />Each candle is $20 each at the current price of $39.99. Although they are made with essential oils, I still think that is too much for the set. Unfortunately, only one candle is agreeable to me.",3
"There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink, purple, and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red, black, and brown in this set. However, this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.<br /><br />I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.",4
"This is an exceptionally well-made and beautiful brush in a travel size. The brush and handle are small, so this brush is not as easy to grasp as one that is full sized. However, It detangles and brushes through my curls with ease. I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion.",5
"This is a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside is nice but the last two words of ""I WIN!"" may be taken wrong; it depends on the girlfriend. <br /><br />TO MY<br /><br />Girlfriend<br /><br />NEVER FORGET THAT<br /><br />I love you<br /><br />THE MOST,<br />I WIN!<br /><br />In summary, this is a lovely gift in a nice gift box. The current price of $22.99 is competitive. I would have given this 5 stars if it were not for the last two words.",4
"I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc.  This set includes three colorful and double-side spatulas/scrubbers. Also included are two thin purple silicone pads with finger holders that are great for washing my face.<br /><br />Each double-sided wand has a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end and another side with larger soft nubs. The nubby side is good for cleaning or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product.<br /><br />The ""egg-shaped"" purple pads are great for scrubbing my face with soap and lathering up. I love the nub that allows me to hold on to this.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent set. These are soft on my skin, pliable, and easy to hold on to. I do wish the wands were just a few inches longer for a better grip. The current price of $13.29 ($13.99 minus 5%) is competitively priced for this set as it comes to $2.66 per item.",5
"This flat iron comes with two strange looking hair clips and a carry pouch. However, gloves were not included in the package as I had expected. It is for this reason I lowered my rating. It is deceiving to the customer to purchase an item thinking it comes with gloves when it does not.<br /><br />The controls are in the center of the iron, so I had to be careful not to burn my fingers. To turn the unit on or off, I just held down the power button for three seconds. To go to the next temperature, I just pressed the on/off button quickly. This flat iron heats rapidly. The temperature selections available go from 300 to 450. I used it at 350 degrees to straighten my hair and I was able to do this relatively quickly as I have short curly hair. Also, there was no frizz after I was done. <br /><br />The clips provided are strange looking as can be seen from the photo. They work good enough to hold some of my hair but I particularly do not care for the design.<br /><br />The soft sided cinch pouch is nice and holds both the iron and the clips.<br /><br />In summary, this is a gorgeous iron. I love how the ""blades"" come together and there is no space in-between like some other irons I tried. Also, the current price of $25.91 ($32.39 minus 20%) is very reasonable for this. The Amazon site says ""DUAL VOLTAGE AND COMPLETE ACCESSORIES ..... Equipped with 1x storage bag, 2x hair clips, and 1x Gloves."" Well it was missing the last item. Had it come with the gloves, I would have rated this 4 stars.",3
"There are two amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, four black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and two standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products. Each bottle holds 16 ounces of liquid. The amber color of the glass helps protect light sensitive products. <br /><br />The current price of $18.98 is competitive but somewhat pricey for this set as it comes to $9.50 per bottle not counting the added incidentals.  Their [[ASIN:B08HGZXLP6 four-pack of bottles]] is about $1 cheaper per bottle.",5
"I have tried many different back brushes including this really good [[ASIN:B08HR2GBHC Kozis brush]] and the buff puff type that lather copiously. However, this one's bristles differ substantially. They are very fine and as soft as a cat's fur.  The soap lathers reasonably well on the bristles and the brush feels great against my skin. It is solidly built. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the title says this is exfoliating and I do not consider that an attribute of this brush. The bristles are too soft to exfoliate. However, it cleans well and feels great to use. I consider it 5 stars for that purpose.  The current price of $16.99 is on the pricey side but I have no similar brush of this bristle style to compare it to. It is certainly not competitively priced with other back brushes which are about $7 cheaper.",4
"There are four amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, six black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and four standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products.

"These shower caps are really attractive in the style I ordered them in. The only issue I have is that I would have preferred them to be a bit snugger. I have a small head and short to medium-length hair, so I need a smaller cap. I am still able to use this in the shower but I have to be careful it does not move around too much.<br /><br />If the elastics were snugger, I would have rated this set of three caps 5 stars.  The current price of $10.99 comes to a reasonable $3.66 each.",3
"There are six (6) velvet headbands with buttons in this set. Each headband is narrow at only 8-3/4"" wide and certainly not as wide as pictured on the Amazon site. Also, there are buttons on each side of the ear area. When I attach my mask to these buttons, my face mask is no longer tight to my face because the slinky velvet material moves and does not stay in place.<br /><br />Overall, I do not like these at all. They will suffice as headbands only and not for mask attachment. The current price of $11.99 comes to $2 per band but I do not feel they are worth that price at all.",2
"I am not sure what a balancing cream is supposed to be. Nevertheless, I applied this to my face and neck (avoiding the eye area). I like the creamy texture and the fragrance is decent. The aroma reminds me a little bit of St. Joseph's aspirin. It did take about ten minutes to absorb fully, but once it did my face and neck felt incredibly hydrated.<br /><br />Note that there are no English instructions on the jar or the box except for the words ""balancing cream."" This is made in Korea and it is written in Korean. If it were not for the Amazon label, no one would know that this is a hydrating face and neck cream. Also, there is no mention of how many ounces this is but I suspect it is about 4 ounces based on the price per ounce listed on Amazon.  The current price of $22.65 is pricey but competitive for this cream. I like it but not enough to order it again.",4
"I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However, these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition, my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.<br /><br />There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope, so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.<br /><br />At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%), it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive, but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. ",4
"There are two body brushes in this package (pastel blue and quartz pink). Each one has a silicone sleeve into which a soft sponge has been inserted. The sleeve has a loop for hanging, nubbs on one side for scrubbing, and various small ridges on the other side for light scrubbing.<br /><br />I used the pink one in my pink bathroom; it matches perfectly. I showered with it and it holds the suds well. I personally like the nubbed side because it is like getting a massage while washing. My favorite bath ""sponge"" is actually a body puff (those with the netting material) because they lather up well. This ""brush"" is now my second favorite. If the suds were prolific with this ""brush"" like the body puffs produce, I would have loved this more than my puffs.<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) is on the pricey side of competitive for this as it comes to $6.30 per body brush.",4
"I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them. However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.",2
"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. The clips are strong and do hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional. The reason I rated this 3 stars is because I also ordered this same set with the blue clips and tan ties. One of the clips in that order broke immediately which tells me these won't last.<br /><br />The current price of $7.19 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong. ",3
"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. I particularly love the blue clips. Unfortunately, the first blue one I tried broke immediately as can be seen in the photo. At least I have one blue left. The clips are strong and do  hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional.<br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong. I'm definitely annoyed about the one clip that broke.",3
"These brushes are actually like eight combs strung together. I had to set the extra piece that comes with each brush to separate the tines. It was not easy to get the bar across the ""combs"" but eventually I managed. There are only two places the bar should be put and that is where the holes are on the back of the ""brush."" I assembled these brushes on the lower holes. My biggest issue with these brushes is that there are only two holes to lock the bar in place when I prefer four holes like my Heeta detangling brush (product number B0836XT7J8 since the Amazon embedded links are not working).<br /><br />Once this is assembled, it glides through the hair and detangles. It works well on dry hair but even better on wet hair. I love the hard tines as it is like getting a massage on the scalp. The handle provides an okay grip but I would have preferred a silicone grip. Since the combs are separated, this brush can act as a vent brush for blow drying even though it is not of circular design. Hair can be removed easily since the tines are flat with no ""ball"" tip.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this three stars is because of the hard time I had assembling the rod in place on each one, the lack of four holes for a secure fit, and the lack of silicone grip on the handle. Otherwise they work well. The current price of $8.99 is reasonable for two detanglers.",3
"There are four tiny colorful squeeze bottles in this package that are easy to fill and easy to dispense. I like that they are portable and can hang on a keychain. These can be used for hand lotion, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, etc. However, the caps do open easily so it is possible the contents will be squeezed out inside a purse if there is a lot of movement. Secondly, the current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for what this is. I would not expect this to be priced at more than $6.",3
"I am highly impressed with this set, particularly the keychain carriers. The carriers are larger than I expected and the tie-dye colors are vibrant and attractive. The pocket in the carrier stretches to accept either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and what feels like neoprene carriers. Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a fine mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles can dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. However, since they are hard, I have to hit the bottle against my hand to dispense any cream as it is not conducive to squeezing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can put my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers. In addition, I can put in a chapstick, nail clipper, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 is very reasonable for this set.",5
"Even though this is baby lotion, I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight, slightly creamy, absorbs rapidly, and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight, it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses, it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.",4
"I am highly impressed with this set, particularly the keychain carriers. The carriers are larger than I expected and the flag colors are vibrant, attractive, and patriotic. The pocket in the carrier stretches to accept either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and the flag carriers.

The current price of $7.27 ($10.39 minus 30% off) is a reasonable price for these sponges.<br /><br />This set of six sponges are as good as all other blending sponges of this type that I tried before. One has a flat side for a smoother application. The pointed ends are good for more precision. They feel good in the hands and blend well and also wash well with soap. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges.,4
"This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients. Also, the conditioner makes the floor of the shower or tub very slippery (almost as if I put Pledge on a floor).  Based on this, I lowered my ranking from 4 to 2 stars.",2
"This single layer thin blue shower disposable shower caps are tiny. They are really for a kids head. I can barely get my hair into this. There are 120 (I did not count them) tiny blue slivers that have to be unraveled. Since they are so small,  these would work best to cover the tops of small serving bowls during a picnic to keep the flies away. These are functional but I am not impressed.",3
"I do not care for these emery boards. There are 16 to the package and the boards are triple thickness compared to the standard personal-sized ones I am use to. However, the gritty surface on mine started to wear off after a few swipes of my nails over the board. Emery boards in general do not last long; however, the size and thickness coupled with the limited longevity makes me not like these. They do file the nails but they do not last.",3
"Surprisingly, I really like this mask. I already tried their [[ASIN:B07VQY9ZP2 WeeklyPoint Cosmetic Saffron mask sheet]] and found it to be very messy and just okay. This one is less messy.<br /><br />There are ten individually wrapped masks in this package. The instructions are in broken English but still easy to understand. I applied this mask to my clean face -- there are holes for eyes, nose, and mouth. It was somewhat wet but not dripping wet as their other mask. I prefer less solution, so this was perfect. I let it stay on for exactly 20 minutes and then removed the mask and wiped off the excess. My face felt moisturized and silky. I reveled in the soft rose fragrance the entire time.  However, the claims that it brightens the skin and protects them from wrinkles is unfounded in my opinion. On the other hand, the rose fragrance is calming and wonderful and the moisturizing effect is silky and these are my two favorite traits of this moisturizing sheet.<br /><br /> ",4
"This pick is absolutely terrible. It is made of flexible plastic that is easily breakable and the pick ends are so thick, they are like scaled down hammer claws that do nothing to scrap the teeth. It went right in the trash.",1
"This comes as a set and no matter what I do, the shampoo bottle will not open. This absolutely infuriates me. I was able to open the conditioner.  I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo. Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product.",1
"This is a nice set of combs--one wide-tooth and one sort of fine-tooth with two regularly-spaced ones. I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.",4
"These headbands remind of Woodstock and the 60's. They are headbands the flower children would wear. The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while. The current price of $16.99 is reasonable for this set.",4
"I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.",4
"I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders. Overall, these are just as good as the sponges from several other vendors I have tried in the past and these are competitively priced at the current price of $10.99 for four. I also love the four color variety.",5
"I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the ""compact pallet holder"" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately.  Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger",4
"[[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This straightener is a nice metallic black and comes with a thin storage sleeve. There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.",3
"I am sorry I ordered this bag and am very disappointed. It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.",1
I purchased the shampoo at CVS several months ago and I absolutely love it. I have fine wavy hair and this shampoo really brings out those curls. I would definitely purchase again. I have not tried their conditioner yet but will some day soon.,5
"After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.",4
"Works great for rhinestoning, made the process faster than the previous tools I’ve used",5
"This was a lifesaver for our son with an acne issue! Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it’s High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br />  trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2” due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we’re on the 25th day of Geologie’s 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I’m most impressed with- this hasn’t caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I’m sure it’s bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I’m not even sure how it does it, maybe it’s witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son’s for past x3 months and I’m actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn’t have a feminine vibe, nothing “fu-fu-“ to turn teen boys away from using “girl stuff!” Trust me, I’ve gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can’t promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results. I’m so happy to have found this and will be looking into the entire product line for future maintenance use. Sorry so long winded.. I wanted to include details for any in a similar situation- I am hoping this info. may be helpful to someone else in need.. Be safe.",5
"So, for a man who thinks his looks strike a resemblance to that of Anderson Cooper.. (bc, of the devilishly handsome silver fox short crew cut) mixed with a longer (3/4”) faux-hawk frontal vibe.. this is a great product to work with this style as it complements the cut really well! As one who’s always used hair gel (daily x30+ yrs!) it’s hard to find one we have not tried. Bold Men casual- sold just under $20 for 3.3oz. Is a higher price point so, the expectations were high and happy to say, this came through impressively.<br /><br />This gel has an ability to last thru the day without becoming razor sharp quills nor, a crusty-crumbly flake after a full day of wear in tear. Being one who prefers a touchable hold (the hardest combo to find btw!!) this gives that to you.. We found, unlike cheaper store bought brands- less is more! (too much will weigh down the hair) **A trick of the trade for any who want to accomplish short spikes- use less product!!<br /><br />Best results came from using no more than  a nickel size amount onto towel (50%) dried hair.. and finger combing into place. The hold stays movably put.. performing better then ever expected- yay!! TBH, this may take getting used too.. IF, you’re norm is the “frozen gel look!” Hack: one can finger style hair into place with this- then, use blow dryer on a lower setting for just a moment.. it will expedite the setting process- giving specific direction to the final look. (A convertible would do the same but.. not sure It’s feasible in winter ha ha!)<br /><br />Product is thick yet, offers just enough slip to give you pliability to style before it settles. Note: color is clear… It’s just the container that is black! After hair is set, this absorbs vs. shellacs to the hair- letting hair have movement and touchable texture.. The scent is nice with a masculine appeal And after 3wks. of daily application we’ve used approx. a tad over 1/4 of content (to give you an idea how long it will last..) thus far, washing daily we’ve noticed no unwanted build up.. which is also a big deal- as this can lead to flakes/Dandruff..!! A good shampoo scrub removes product easily enough.. and paired with daily conditioner, it’s not over-drying to the hair. Making the $ seem worth all the quality benefits.<br /><br />This is a top quality higher end product that best fits those who have a moveable set style they like their hair to maintain throughout the day.. this can achieve the desired look and look fantastic- and does so, without all the unwanted side effects that can come with daily use of hair gel.. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",5
"This was a great product made to be helpful For moisturizing but, also being sensitive enough for use on a newborns skin. The baby i had ordered this for, has a unique combo- half Icelandic and half African… Creating skin mixture that needs very delicate and natural products that still can provide plenty of moisture. This product delivered!!<br /><br />After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia’s baby bath oil on the scalp. Not only was it very sensitive and user-friendly, it took care of the issue within a few days.. The other concern was the possibility of getting product in babies eyes, if added to the overall bathwater.. of course, I used my best efforts to keep this from happening- but, I found dipping washcloth into the water and wiping off face… Absolutely caused zero problems- I was totally surprised and impressed!!<br /><br />Knowing the African culture needs a bit of moisturizer in skin care as well as hair care… This has covered both needs in just this one product. I’m certain as this newborn grows we may need to adjust course and add more specific hair care regiment. As for now, this is doing just fine- and best of all leaves baby smelling amazing!!<br /><br />So, if looking for a product that is gentle enough to use on a newborn… That has taken the precautions to keep their skin safe… Using only natural products- and has the ability to moisturize and even clear up cradle cap.. just a few drops of this to the bathwater- can handle the trouble spots no problem.. loving it!!",4
"Yes, it does smell good...",5
We've been using their products for over 5 years now and it IS one of the best.,5
Easy to use. I suggest using the one you like least first because I messed the first ones up. Make sure not to run any hot water over them for quit some time. Other than that the second patches I used stayed on for about 3 days until I noticed chips.,4
"Flushes the residual food particles like a ToTo toilet flushes.  Off the bat this works excellently, and it is when you recharge them that they just stop working.  I have recharged this once now, and so far so good, but this isn't my first purchase.  Whilst it is works, it is a powerful addition to self care.",3
"Starters, I LOOOOOOOOVE tea tree scent, strong, but not overpowering or nasty in synthetic way.  As conditioner, really liked that the product didn't have greasy or heavy feel as I applied it to my hair.  Nice smoothness after drying, liked the feel,of my hair, but no major fragrance afterwards, which I like.  Treats my scalp in good condition too.",5
it's missing bristles and it's splintered on the back! i found one at target for $5.,1
Perfect fit and perfect quality.,5
"Love this stuff, works well, nice light scent. Decent size bottle, good price.",5
"These work really well. These are better than Biore strips. They are a little difficult to get off the clear sheet, but they stick well and they really clean the pores.",5
"I usually use the orange Real Techniques makeup sponge. The diamond sponge is pretty much the same, just a different color and shape. The diamond is much cuter. However, the orange sponge is an overall better shape. I mean, this one will do, but the hard cut edges vs. soft curves make it a little less of an ideal shape for use. But it makes up for that in being really cute.",5
Happy I can still find these for my mom good quality,5
I love holographic nail polish does it work definitely the only issues I really have with it the price and the size of the bottle there really is no reason for it to be in such a small bottle,5
Just nail polish despite numerous attempts just will not put the cat by Design on in anything that is almost so faded you cannot forget it cannot be blamed on the magnets because I have probably close to 25 magnets and I have run into the same problem with all of them follow the instructions to a T and it's always very very faded,1
And here we have another product that I am still not thrilled with your hair and your hair is close to yourself and what happens when the plastic cap comes off the end and the metal snap and now you have a big chunk of metal poking you in the head yeah I'm not happy at all I have not even contacted the vendor because I don't want sound mean to them how upset I am with the quality that is not here. Replacement would be nice,1
Terrible quality. Did not even last 18hours.,1
We mostly use essential oils in diffusers with only a little concern for holistic effects.  But we do run peppermint and lavender for stress relief.  We have been very happy with these in the diffuser.  They smell great and come in nice little bottles.  It would be a great little gift set although the box is not overly ornate.  I can't really do better to describe it than to say it is a decent intro set.,4
"We discovered Essie nail polish a while ago and it quickly became my partners favorite.  But that was the Gel Couture line which has been known to stand up to entire canoe trips into Minnesota's Boundary Waters.  This is truly good nail polish, but as she says, &#34;this is more for people who do their nails daily or at least don't expect it to last through a hike.&#34;<br /><br />We did like the Let it Glow Pink color, and we like the brand, but they set their own bar high.  This is definitely a good polish, just their other line is better.",4
"This deodorant has a fairly strong scent that lasts a long time. I haven't notice any staining on any of my tshirts and have been using it consistently for about 5 weeks. If I had anything critical to say about this product, it might be a little too strongly scented, but it works and I've been happy with it.",5
It looks awkward when put on your head and it’s a lot shorter and curlier than it’s advertised. You also have to style it yourself.,1
I really like the product and have been searching for other colors.,5
One of the tubes seem to be a less full than the other two and the wrapping around all 3 is coming unglued,3
"I absolutely love this wig! It is sooooo soft and it looks and feels real! It's easy to install. I love the packaging it came in which included eyelashes(thank you)! The box is very nice, durable and reusable. I'm a sucker for reusing nice packaging to store my wig when I'm done with it for a little while. I highly recommend this wig and this brand!",5
"The shower sponges are just slightly smaller than the average ones sold, however, I'm sure with daily use they will expand fine.  So far, so good.  Sent in a zip-lock style bag to maintain cleanliness, nice touch.  No choice as to colors, but I received two green, two purple and two blue, with a traditional rope loop for hanging. Pleased with purchase, will update once we've used one for a length of time.",4
"I purchased these items for creating essential oils products for cleaning, health, and first aid.  These bottles are beautiful cobalt blue bottles, and the perfect size to fit into medicine cabinet. I love that they came with labels.",5
"This is just okay for what I needed it for.  I know the ridge around it has a purpose, but, for me it didn't work.  However, I find that is  well made.  I am using it to set my potted plants on.  I ordered it for shoes, but, I also think it needs to be a little heavier for that.",3
"This doesn’t leave my hair as soft and moisturizing as the mask, but works great.",5
"Wonderful for skin and hair, really works!!!",5
"Excellent color for my fair skin. The Nude color is just right in winter months, the Buff Beige for the summer months. Applies easily and absorbs and drys quickly.<br /><br />The primer was a delightful surprise that my skin loved.<br /><br />The sponges were playful but clunkier and firmer than I like.<br /><br />The plastic tote is a nice idea but I didn't care for how cheap it looked and felt.",5
Not only does the soap feel like luxury on the skin it looks like luxury. I am very happy the scent is subtle and unique. The lather is rich and rinses clean. Don't miss this.,5
"You could use this as a hand soap as well as a wash to use in the shower. Washes away easily, lathers up nicely and comes in a attractive plastic bottle that is good enough for company. I could not be happier.",5
"Comes fully charged. 100% waterproof. There is only ONE 3 headed grinder. The packing list on the product page  lists ""3 x 3 in 1 Grinding Heads"", so I believed it came with 2 replacement heads, The marketing materials show you how to replace the head, however I am unable to find where to obtain them. Hopefully by the time these wear out in a year they will be available.",4
"I LOVE the colors! I have very thick hair so hairbands are almost always snug and this is the same width as most hairbands. Vibrant color. The buttons are placed EXACTLY where you need them. The seller includes extra buttons. The buttons are not removable but when you take the mask off you can flip the hairband so the buttons face inward so you don't see them.  I like the big white buttons, they give me a retro 1940's look.",5
"I can get 750 J&J Qtips for a $4.64. So this all comes down to the environment.<br /><br />The J&J swabs come in plastic container and these come in a box which is kinder to the planet.<br /><br />These have a bamboo stem and the J&J are plastic! (I always thought they were paper!). And I am LOVING how sturdy the stems are: they don't bend, not that I use force when using, it just makes for a sure grip.<br /><br />I did a side by side and the tips are the same thickness.",5
"Terrific list of ingredients, this stuff is the real deal. I could feel immediately on application that this product contained Retinol as advertised and not a watered down 'serum' variation. Remember to moisturize after. This is a terrific product to use as your Retinol go to.<br /><br />I got a lot of info from Marie Claire article by Katie Thomas 'Retinol - the only ingredient that will reduce wrinkles'<br /><br />Your skin’s collagen level starts to deplete at age 25.<br />Retinol helps with skin elasticity, wrinkles/laugh lines and pigmentation aka age spots.<br />Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A.<br />Start low ( 0.3%)  increase to 0.5%. 1% is best but only available with a prescription.<br />When you first try your skin may get dry, red & flaky.<br />Only use twice a week, gradually increase to daily as desired.<br />Apply a pea-sized amount at first and increase amount and % as negative side effects decrease.<br />Use anytime day or night, just use sunscreen after if going outdoors.<br />Anywhere you see signs of aging is a good place to apply, face, arms, hands, legs, neck.<br />Avoid the skin around your eyes as it is too delicate.<br /><br />Aqua/Water/Eau,<br />Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (emollient/natural moisturizing factor/replenishment/texture),<br />Glycerin (hydration/natural moisturizing factor/replenishment),<br />Dimethicone (conditioner/silicone),<br />Glyceryl Stearate (emollient/emulsifier),<br />PEG-100 Stearate (emulsifier),<br />Polysorbate 20 (emulsifier),<br />***Retinol (age delay/brightener),<br />Phenoxyethanol (preservative),<br />Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer (hydration/replenishment/restoration),<br />Carbomer (thickener),<br />Cetearyl Alcohol (thickener),<br />Caprylyl Glycol (conditioner/emollient/preservative),<br />Ceteareth-20 (emollient/emulsifier),<br />Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative),<br />BHT (preservative), Allantoin (sooth),<br />Disodium EDTA (pH buffer/preservative),<br />Hexylene Glycol (preservative),<br />Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster),<br />Pentylene Glycol (solvent),<br />BHA (preservative),<br />1,2-Hexanediol (preservative),<br />Beta-Glucan (antioxidant/sooth),<br />Myristoyl Pentapeptide-8 (age delay)",5
"but it isn't certified organic, so is it? I have Aloe plants, but when traveling having Aloe Vera in a bottle is terrific. Also if you are looking to make your own hand sanitizer this is great to add to isopropyl alcohol.<br /><br />Sdara is a Canadian Company that has been around since at least 2016.",2
"I smell like furniture polish, it was piercingly unpleasant.",3
It's like having your own Aloe plant in a bottle because the first ingredient is Aloe. We do have an Aloe plant in our home.  The bonus is the vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid (improves skin elasticity). This works great on sunburn!!!<br /><br />In a pinch you can use this and mix with isopropyl alcohol (30/70 mix) and make hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This really well packaged to prevent leakage in transit and you can reuse it to keep little fingers from depressing the product.,5
"The Removable/detachable Water Tank is not removable nor detachable. I studied the user manual and no mention on how to remove it so you can clean it.<br /><br />It doesn't come with an adapter so unless you have an extra you will be charging with your laptop. FYI will not operate while charging.<br /><br />The full water tank lasts for 50 seconds of continuous flossing.<br /><br />A Full battery will last 30 minutes before needing a recharge. Charging time:4-6 Hours. Charging voltage:5V.<br />Cleaning modes are gentle/standard/pulse massage. High pressure water pulse, 20-140PSI water pressure. ** Make sure to not lose the little white tab that covers the charger port - you'll need it to keep it waterproof.",3
"This is the real deal. Designed for naturally curly, wavy or grey hair,  or any hair type that needs deep conditioning.  I have 50 year old curly highlighted Irish hair. My styist actually noticed how soft it felt and controllable it looked.  The product calls it Curl Rescue with Keravis Ultra Conditioning Formula for Curls. No Sulfate or paraben; alcohol & cruelty free. With keratin and Vitamin B5.<br /><br />It is doubled packaged inside a mylar container to control any spill in transit.",5
"Unbeatable! The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  I switch the brush out every 3 months or so.  I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this. a small amount of toothpaste does a great job. Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.",5
Very pleased with iron. It makes great curls and can also straighten hair when you want different look,5
"Love the way it sticks to the counter! It's a great size for me. I mix all of my dog's food in it, then put it in their individual bowls. I'm going to need this bowl in all different sizes. It's made very well!",5
Perfect !,5
Great for acne prone skin,5
"It’s great, feels perfect and does not permit my hair to get wet!",5
"The wig in the picture is not the wig i received. It's lighter in color, part is on the side not in the middle and does not lay right.",2
"If you find yourself reaching for lip balm throughout the day, you may want to upgrade to a lip mask. It works either at night or during the day. This one has a light vanilla scent that can be used by anyone. It doesn't just coat your lips. It actually nourishes and gently exfoliates. A little goes a long way. It makes a good base for other lip products. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.",5
"Body illuminator are great at highlighting your gifts and blurring flaws. I like that this formula is made for sweaty conditions. Considering you use products like this mostly in warm weather, it makes sense to offer this feature. It's easy to apply and resists transfer. The coverage is buildable. You can shimmer a little or a lot. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.",5
"There's a Chinese actress who attributes her perfect skin to twice-daily sheet masks. After using one per night for several months, I totally believe they work. This mask is the best for hydration. It can be used by all skin types. The sheet is soft and flexible. You can stretch it as needed. I always stretch the eye holes since I have larger eyes. It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also. The best part about this set is that you get so many masks. You can try using one nightly to see how it changes your skin. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.",5
"I'm a true skincare addict. I really like these holiday sets. They're a good way to try new products. Caudalie is a cult favorite for a reason. Their products are made from the grapes in their vineyards. You get all the benefits of the resveratrol in pretty packaging. This set comes with a moisturizer, serum and foaming cleanser. They come in travel sizes, so it's just enough to decide whether you like them or not. This set is a great value. It makes the perfect gift. As a note, my box was a bit banged up. The products weren't properly glued to the base, so they came out in the shipping package. Other than that, I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"With winter approaching, it's time to start thinking about cold-weather skincare. This moisturizer is a good choice because it's a blend of several skin-loving oils like argan, coconut and macadamia. It's fairly lightweight but it protects and hydrates like a heavier cream. It can be used both day and night. The packaging is pretty enough for display. It can be used by all skin types. I highly recommend this product and the entire line from this brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"If you have any level of melanin in your skin, you know the struggle with hyperpigmentation. Any red spot that comes out on my skin eventually turns brown. This moisturizer is deeply hydrating in addition to being a powerful brightener. It helps to get rid of blemishes and dark spots faster than most OTC treatments. Use it twice per day for best results. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"A healthy barrier leads to healthy skin. This serum helps to repair your skin's natural barrier, locking in moisture and blocking bacteria and irritants. It contains niacinamide which helps to reduce inflammation and redness. Centella heals skin and makes it more resilient to environmental damage. The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's safe to use twice daily. It's ideal for dry, irritated or acne-prone skin. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
A balance pH level is important for healthy hair. This conditioner helps to balance your hair's pH level in addition to repairing damage. It's also very hydrating. It has just the right amount of oil to tame curly hair. The scent is fresh and lightly herbaceous. The texture is on the thicker side but not like a deep conditioner. It's a good overall product for all hair types.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
"Sheet masks are my favorite way to give my skin special treatment. You get six masks in this set. Three masks are aloe-based, three have pomegranate extract. Aloe is well known for healing and soothing skin. Pomegranate brightens and plumps. Each mask is soaked in serum. There's enough to cover your neck in what's left in the package. The masks are so juicy that the serum may drip down into your eyes. If you have large eyes, widen the eye holes with your fingers so the top of the hole is at or above your brow. If you refrigerate the masks before application, you'll get the benefit of cooling your skin's temperature and reducing inflammation. I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"I'm a curly girl. One of the constant struggles with my type of hair is that it may look dull sometimes since it's so dark. This shine spray is like a makeover in a bottle. It adds instant shine and makes it look like you had a color touch-up. The formula is lightweight and non-greasy. It has a light, somewhat floral scent. I would definitely spend my own money to purchase this product. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. It's one of the reasons why people with oily skin seem to be ageless for so long. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
I like to keep extra spray bottles on hand. They're useful for so many purposes. I like to put all of my liquid hair products in them because it's much easier to use a trigger sprayer than a pump when your hands are wet. You can also use them for cleaning products or fabric sprays. This set is a good buy.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
I use lots of sheet masks. Most leave your skin a little sticky when the serum dries. This mask works differently. The sheet locks the moisture in and doesn't leave a sticky residue. It's a great hydration and brightening mask. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
"I really like that this mask includes special patches for the eyes and smile lines. If you're over 30, you'll appreciate the extra help. You apply the patches first, the the sheet mask. I keep all of my sheet masks in the refrigerator. You'll appreciate the cooling and anti-inflammatory effect if you do so with this mask. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"Sheet masks are my favorite part of my skincare routine. They give you time to indulge in ""me time"". These masks work to both hydrate and treat skin. The material adheres to skin well and stretches if you need a little extra coverage. The serum brightens skin and gets rid of dullness. Your skin will look plump and radiant after the first use. I suggest keeping the masks in the refrigerator prior to use. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"These vacuum spray bottles are very easy to use. They're especially useful for cosmetic products that contain ingredients that start to degrade when exposed to air. They're ideal for toners, hydrating mists and even essences. They pack well and are leak-resistant. This is a great buy.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"I really like this moisturizer. It's lightweight and creamy. It has a light cucumber scent that I find refreshing. It's a powerhouse at deeply hydrating parched skin. It also locks in moisture to keep skin looking fresh. It contains botanicals that soothe irritated or inflamed skin. It's ideal for those with acne, rosacea or eczema. You can use it as both a day and night cream. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"If you're over 35, this serum is a must. It contains two powerful skin-saving ingredients. Vitamin C keeps skin bright and radiant. It protects skin from UV damage. It boosts collagen production and helps fade dark spots quickly. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin draw moisture from the environment. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's hard to find a high quality organic serum like this. I highly recommend this serum and the brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"I love water cream moisturizers, especially in warmer weather. This one is light as a feather, but provides intense moisture. It leaves skin feeling silky and refreshed. You don't need much, so this jar will last a while. The formula is good for all skin types, but I especially recommend it for oily skin. You can use it both day and night. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
Warm weather means unruly hair if you're a curly girl. Headbands are a staple for me. These have a fun tropical feel. They're very soft and stretchy. They should fit most heads. I'd get a couple different sets of these because I like them so much. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

"If you have eczema, rosacea or psoriasis this serum will soothe and hydrate your skin. The cica (centella asiatica) is known to treat and heal irritated skin. It also helps to reduce redness and inflammation. Use twice daily for best results. I highly recommend this serum.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"This mask set allows you to choose exactly what your skin needs on any given day. There are five types. There's one for hydration, firming, brightening, healthy aging, and pore detoxing. For best results, leave the masks on for at least 15 minutes. Use the excess serum on your neck. I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"Every mascara claims to be new and different. This one actually lives up to the hype. The fibers have a novel shape that really makes your lashes POP. If you're not a fan of falsies, this is a great alternative. The formula isn't waterproof, so keep that in mind. I HIGHLY recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
Native makes some of the best natural deodorants on the market. They're just as effective as the drugstore brands. I like this set because you get three different scents. My favorite is the peony. The scents are all fresh and light. They won't clash with other fragrances you wear. This set is perfect for gifting. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
Tea tree is one of my favorite essential oils because it has so many uses. It helps acne blemishes to heal quickly. It can be used as a topical antibiotic. You can add it to hair and scalp treatments to promote growth and scalp health. It's also a calming scent when used in a diffuser. You'll probably find more uses for it over time. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
"This moisturizer is ideal for most skin types. It is fairly lightweight and provides deep hydration. It's especially good for sensitive or reactive skin. It's a good choice for those with rosacea, eczema or acne. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
I pretty much chose this product based on the shout-out to Arrested Development. This is a loose pigment with a super-fine texture. I opened it when a ceiling fan was on and it went flying. You'll want to use this with a mixing medium to make it stick. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
Hyaluronic acid is really one of the best skincare ingredients to use for hydrated skin. It keeps skin looking dewy and plump. You can add it to your moisturizer or apply it directly. Add a few drops to a mud/clay mask to make it a balancing treatment.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
This set makes it really easy to travel with your favorite beauty items. The dispensers are attractive and very easy to fill. It  comes with labels so you know what's in each section. You can continue to reuse them for different items if you rinse them out. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
"Sweet orange is one of my favorite essential oils. It immediately makes me feel energized and refreshed. This body wash is the perfect way to start your day. The scent will perk you up and get you moving. The formula is very moisturizing and won't strip your skin. The fragrance is unisex, so it would make a good gift for women and men. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"If you're reading this review, you probably already know the anti-aging benefits of collagen. This mask has a high-potency form of collagen along with a special delivery system to help firm your skin. The mask is in two parts, so you can get a better fit than a regular sheet mask. I can't say it performs miracles, but it's definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
I'm trying to do a better job with paying as much attention to the ingredients in my skincare as those in my food. This is a great natural cleanser. It's very gentle and is good for sensitive skin. The lactic acid hydrates and gently exfoliates over time. You won't need a science degree to understand the majority of the ingredients. This is a great clean beauty cleanser that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
"As a curly girl, I'm very familiar with using hair oils. This one is an organic blend of argan oil and shea butter. Both are excellent for hair. You can use this as a shine booster, hot oil treatment, or anything else you choose. You could even try it as an overnight treatment. It's a great product. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
"These sheet masks are great for dry or dehydrated skin. They're especially good to use in cold or dry weather. The masks contain an extract of oolong tea and hyaluronic acid. Your skin will look dewy and radiant after 10-20 minutes. Make sure the mask is smoothed over your skin. If you have a jade roller, it's nice to use it over the mask to increase absorption. I highly recommend both this mask and the entire product line.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5
A good hand cream is essential. This one is excellent. It is thick and creamy. It's very moisturizing and is packed with skin-loving botanicals. It's fragrance-free in case you have allergies or just prefer the unscented option. This is a high-quality hand cream that's great to keep in your bag.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,5
I'll admit it. I cheaped out on my spray bottle. I'm glad I upgraded. This is so easy to use. It makes wash day and styling so much easier. I only wish it came in a larger size. I highly recommend this.,5
This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. It smells like a tropical vacation and leaves my curls plump and shiny. It's like the Holy Grail of natural hair products.,5
"More narrow than I thought and def flimsy material. Also thought it would stick better but it didn’t. After the water starting filling the tub, they started getting lose which defeats the purpose. Total waste of $ for me.",2
"It was not at all what I thought was advertised! I was expecting a tinted lotion! As a plain lotion, it’s still doesn’t get any stars! It’s very thin and runny! Sorry Joan!",1
"I love this hair bun maker, it is the easiest one I have used!",5
20 minutes of fragrance nothing more. $30 plus dollars for this!! I wanted Donna Karen cashmere mist but the shipping took too long. Wish now I would've waited.  It does nothing for sweat absolutely nothing!!  It's so small too.,1
"I have for years dealt with dry, cracked heels, and I have tried a number of things to correct the issue. While my heels haven’t hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It’s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven’t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a “bite” to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don’t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress – my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they’re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It’s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.",5
"I selected this little hair remover/shaver for my wife, to replace a trimmer she had simply worn out over time. This trimmer is a bit different than many of the others I have seen of its type which look more like mascara applicators. After one use, my wife is very pleased with it.<br /><br />This trimmer is similar to a rotary shaver that men use to shave (except one head instead of three) and is similar in size to a glue stick. It runs on a single AA battery and is relatively quiet.<br /><br />After figuring out how to use it, my wife trimmed a single hair and was pleased, and then did something that really surprised me – she used it to dry shave her whole leg. It did a surprisingly good job and actually left her leg smooth, but it took a really long time to finish. This is absolutely not the job for which this little trimmer was designed, but apparently it will work in a pinch.<br /><br />Compared to other trimmers she has used, this one is very gentle and when it’s turned on it doesn’t sound like it’s laboring like some of the others do.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little hair trimmer, designed for facial hair. It’s small, quiet and works well.",5
"Purchased these 15 months ago and all are still completely functional. Strong Zippers, wide opening and easy to clean. Use for storage around the house every day. We Highly recommend this brand InnoGear and this product. Sturdy construction!",5
"The curved ends on almost all of these is not curved & angled enough to twist & clasp, at all. I cant get them to clasp, even when they are not in my hair. This was a huge waste of money.",1
"Adorable! I love the super soft fabric and the quality stitching. I did not realize these were not stitctched to appear to be tied,  which I really like- Mommy actually ties it to create a custom fit for their baby’s head. Perfect!!! Hope to see more sets, specifically solid colors (pastels, primary colors, neons) My daughter and daughter in law love them.",5
"Don't waste your money,I  have power cord issues all the time and it continously stops on me.<br />I would not recommend this for beginners because I find it to be very frustrating.<br />This product needs a lot of improvement. I'm buying a new today from another company...",2
The best hairspray I have found for my fine blonde hair. Not stiff and you can style after spraying .,5
"Dry, crumbly and impossible to even get on.  Smells were not my favorite.  Won’t buy again.",2
This is a joke. They do not work. Do not waste time or money.,1
"Smash box lipstick is always buttery smooth. All their shades have a rich longer lasting pigment, even the nudes.",5
"The lashed are pretty but the band is too wide, it covers too much of the eyelid. Also the way it's packaged makes it difficult to remove from plastic casing and tears the lash strip.",3
"The lashed are pretty but the band is too wide, it covers too much of the eyelid. Also the way it's packaged makes it difficult to remove from plastic casing and tears the lash strip.",2
This hair is the worst ever..all the ends came down,1
My granddaughter wanted this and I was skeptical. But being grandma I ordered it! She loves it. Super easy to use and looks great on. The polish lasts well. Great value for the price.,5
when I applied a little pressure the wheel stopped spinning. Not enough power.,2
"These look and fit BAD.<br />Fake looking.<br />Not dentures fake- Halloween fake.<br />Plus they don't conform in your mouth. They are bulky. They require major adjustments with power tools to fit properly. These are a joke. If your getting them for a prank or to play dress up, I guess they’d do.<br />If you need a decent temporary smile that looks and feels good, go with Imako.",1
This is far too heavy and greasy to be applied on the eyes.  It earned stars because it wasn't a total waste; it will work as a lip balm.,2
"Feels great on, but the colors are very very bright.  In the end, these are too intense of a color for me, so I ordered the clear version, which I LOVE, and use every day.",5
To strong for my liking so I have to my daughter she likes it,3
"Aeroblend is The Best airbrush foundation. It looks just like my natural skin when applied. I purchased my Aeroblend system in November, and it's Wonderful! Since November, I have tried Luminess, Belloccio, and Aeroblend foundations. I had hoped I would like Belloccio because it's half the price, but it could not compare to the Aeroblend Foundation.  The Luminess was too sticky, like it never set. The Aeroblend looks Absolutely Flawless. It takes minutes to do my makeup now, and so many people have asked me about my skin. I am so glad I purchased my Aeroblend system!",5
"very impressed with this!  It doesn't fry my hair, my hair feels sleek and without static electricity.<br />Also I didn't know it doubles as a flat iron, 2 in 1 product. love it!",5
"hard to find black, i love it",5
So comfy,5
"There is no plug for the water to help freeze instead of leaking out, not freezing well!",1
Fun wigs for our wig & wine party,5
The brush is wonderfully made. Its thickness really helps with messaging the scalp .,5
This moisturizer is so yummy! It's light weight but super hydrating! It smells so yummy! I'm really picky and I love the scent! It has great ingredients I just wish they had another option for a bigger bottle 😍🥥🥥🥥💝 I used this moisturizer on my boyfriend's face and mine and we both loved it :),5
"These shiny facial massage cryo sticks chill quickly, and I love that they come packaged within a clear plastic storage case with an instruction card! You can actually hear the anti-freeze/non-toxic liquid gel floating and bobbing around inside each stainless steel spoon/orb, and I love the ergonomic shape of each tool! The brightly colored turquoise handle tips help protect my fingers from the cold, and these futuristic-looking devices sit and balance nicely on various parts of my face! They do a great job of reducing swelling, puffiness, and fluid retention, and I think they’d make an affordable and unique gift for fans of at-home, cold therapy techniques! ☃️",5
"I absolutely love this dual-headed face roller!! It’s gorgeously colored, easy to hold, attractively packaged, and competitively priced. I especially love using it after I’ve cleansed my skin and applied moisturizer, right before I start putting on my makeup. It instantly helps depuff my skin, and it seems to enhance the smooth coverage of every cream and foundation I use immediately afterwards. It has definitely become part of my daily skincare routine, and the aluminum alloy rollers are super smooth and manage to apply the perfect amount of weighted pressure!",5
"The lavender bath bomb and rose-scented bath bomb and soap bar all feature light, feminine scents that pair nicely with the included candle! The stainless steel cup seems well-constructed and nicely sized, and the various tools and bottle openers are an appreciated bonus. This boxed set is ready for gifting and even comes with a blank card that can be easily personalized to some lucky recipient. I think this grouped assortment offers a nice variety of different and relaxing products that most customers would enjoy!",5
"I’ve used many Korean face masks before but never a hair mask specifically! I love that the treatments come packaged in individual pouches (which makes them perfect for travel), and I like that they come as a boxed set. After shampooing my hair and brushing it straight, it tucks easily into one of these pre-filled bags, and it’s simple enough to squish and massage the conditioning product around. I usually keep one on for a couple of hours, and it seems like the body heat associated with activity and movement helps the essence really penetrate every strand.<br /><br />The attached straps are easy to affix and release, and the product washes out smoothly enough and manages to leave my hair super shiny too! I love that this formula contains a blend of kernel oil, fermented yeast extract, and soybean seeds because they mix nicely with all of the floral notes and botanical aromas! These deep-conditioning treatments seem to work wonders for my color-treated and often heat-styled hair!",5
"I like the details of the twist-front designs on these stretchy headbands, and all of the fabrics feel soft and lightweight. Each one is easy enough to wash, and they come in a wide range of attractive colors, so I usually leave a couple in my car for unexpected hikes and impromptu workout sessions. They’re also great for holding my hair back during morning and evening skincare sessions, so I’d gladly recommend this multicolored variety pack to others!",5
"I think this is a great set of utilitarian beauty tools! If you've ever tried to apply a goopy face mask with just your fingers (looking at you gold-infused charcoal paste), then you know the struggle that often comes with scooping up products and then trying to spread them evenly before they start to dry in place. These bendy silicone-tipped spatula brush sticks and paddles streamline the entire process!<br /><br />All of the tools are lightweight, easy to clean, and they seem to be fairly durable! I love the candy-colored palette of pastel hues, and the various textures and tips offer plenty of versatility and flexibility. They are also great for hygienically scooping up globs and dollops of various creams and moisturizers that need to be kept as sanitary as possible for repeated applications. I'd definitely recommend this tool set to others!",5
"These medical-grade silicone scar removal sheets are so versatile! Acne scars, burn scars, and post-surgical scars all benefit from the consistent application of this painless product, and I love that it’s a viable alternative to topically applied creams and gels. I love that the flexible material comes rolled up like tape, and I appreciate that it can be cut and trimmed into custom shapes and sizes. The chosen flesh tone would likely suit many users, so it at least provides a certain degree of modest skin camouflage.<br /><br />The silicone component brightens, hydrates, moisturizes, softens, and repairs damaged skin, so repeated use truly does seem to make a noticeable difference. Scars slowly start to fade as the skin regeneration process kicks into high gear, and these sheets are actually reusable, washable, flexible, breathable, and easy to apply!",5
"I have tried and tested many rollers and scrapers recently, so I inspected this duo closely. The gold hardware on this dual-ended roller seems reliably attached, and both ends roll freely, but the larger end does seem to have a small issue that causes it to bump with each revolution, preventing the rolling motion from being completely smooth and silent. That being said, it still adequately applies smooth and even pressure to the face with each systematic use!<br /><br />The gua sha scraper exhibits some scattered scuffs and scrapes, and the edges and “v” angle have some rough, white areas they don’t look perfectly polished, but all natural stones have imperfections to some degree. This set comes attractively packaged, and it seems to be affordably priced, so it might be a great choice for consumers looking for a starter facial set!",4
"I’ve greatly enjoyed using this organic clover honey face mask! The texture is smooth and dreamy, and it seems to offer me a very nourishing skin treatment every time I use it. It rinses away cleanly after 20-30 minutes of wear, and I also love that this bee-powered skincare product is made in the USA, so I’d definitely recommend it to other consumers in search of a honey-infused facial concoction! Oh, and both the glass jar and paper box are recyclable, so it’s an eco-conscious pairing all around. 👍🏽♻️",5
"This multicolored variety pack of headbands is so eye-catching, and the entire set has been quite affordably priced! Each headband is lightweight, adorably designed, and universally sized, and the elastic portions along the back feel reliable and secure. The decorative plastic buttons on each side can sustain some pull, so I believe that they’re there to optionally provide a resting place for the ear loops of face masks. Regardless, I think all of the patterns are vivid and cute, so I’d gladly recommend these boho hair accessories to others!",5
"This foaming cleanser genuinely provides an oil-free approach to daily acne control. I like that it contains botanical extracts, and it seems to provide a gentle, yet thorough, clean! It’s nicely packaged, affordably priced, has a pleasant scent, a 2+ year shelf life, and it always leaves my skin feeling nourished, soft, and smooth. I’d recommend it to others without hesitation!",5
"I can honestly say that this was the first time I’ve ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I’m always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they’d be super easy to “seat” properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you’re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn’t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I’m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I’m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it’s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it’s worth giving these a try!",4
"This hand soap provides an effective and hygienic sense of all-natural clean! While I don’t readily detect a heady scent of lavender oil, I will say that an earthy tea tree scent is freshly omnipresent. I love that this is a vegan, cruelty-free product that’s been consciously sourced, packaged, and produced, and the included pump dispenser seems to be quite sturdy and reliable. I appreciate that the bottle arrived with a secure safety seal in place, and I definitely didn’t have any product leak out during shipment. There’s also an expiration date handily provided on the bottle’s base.<br /><br />This slippery, soapy gel solution creates a visible sudsing effect, and it feels quite hydrating overall! It rinses away cleanly and leaves my family’s hands feeling nice and soft every time. I love using essential oils to help provide a renewed sense of revitalization and freshness around my home, so I’m gladly adding this Canadian hand wash to my daily cleansing arsenal.",5
"This is the first time I’ve ever used a stainless steel version of a gua sha scraper tool, but I’ve been decidedly pleased with the overall results! I love the super slick, shiny surface of this heart-shaped piece, and it’s always cool to the touch at room temperature. It’s comfortable to hold, has a very slim profile, and it always immediately provides a relaxing sense of rebalanced alignment. This gua sha tool also comes with a pink polishing cloth and a red leather storage pouch! The snap is secure and reliable, the stitching is straight, and the scraper device fits snugly inside. I’m really pleased with this product overall!",5
"These do make affordably unique party favor gifts! The holographic print diamond ring designs are pretty, and I think the featured wording is memorable and cute! I will say that these hair coils are slightly larger than several others I’ve tried, so they don’t seem to be as tight and stretchy as the ones I’m generally used to, but they do make a nice “ring” design for the card, and the iridescent shade of purple is really attractive. Since they all come squashed together in a plastic bag with a slide zipper, they do move around and bend a lot. Because of that, 3 of the 7 decorative backing cards I received had obvious crinkles and bends across one bottom corner. They did flatten back out for the most part, but I still wish I’d received an entire set of pristine cards that were undamaged. They’d make great gifts for bachelorette parties or bridal shower events!",4
"This ivory-colored bath mitt comes packaged in a resealable pink pouch, and it’s super lightweight! The packaging says it is 100% natural silk, but it does look and feel more like a linen/cotton fabric. Regardless, it’s soft enough to be gentle, but just textured enough to provide some noticeable friction for exfoliation! It fits comfortably over my hand, and it’s simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I’ve used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions. I’d recommend this natural glove for all skin types, and it can be used in conjunction with bath OR shower time. I’d realistically pay $12-$15 for it, but I’m pleased with its overall performance!",5
"Vitamin C is definitely an essential component of a healthy body and skincare routine, and I love that this smooth cream also contains shea butter, vitamin E oil, rosemary, jojoba oil, aloe vera, cocoa butter, and lavender essential oil. This lotion has a pleasant scent, and it seems to work great with overnight applications. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized the next morning, and it has even helped diminish the appearance of minor blemishes over time. I love that this product is USDA-certified organic and that it’s made in small batches in the USA! The tub comes adequately sealed with a clearly marked expiration date, and I think it’s affordably priced for the results it provides. 🌤",5
"I love this skincare set! The pale pink rose quartz hue is such a pretty shade, and the paired duo arrives safely nestled within a cushioned pillow of foam cutouts. The dual-ended roller exhibits smooth and silent movement, and the gua sha stone is perfectly sized and comfortable to hold! The warm gold metal hardware pieces complement the pink color beautifully, and the overall craftsmanship of this set is impressive. This product would make a chic and affordable gift for yourself or a loved one!",5
"The blend of royal jelly, botanical, and floral extracts gives this Korean beauty essence a nice ingredient profile, and the overall scent is pleasingly fresh and sweet. Each of the pouches has a small twist-off cap and the liquid contents are clear (and seem to have a high water content). The spread solution initially dries a little stickier than I’d prefer it to (stickier than a well-absorbed moisturizing lotion would), but the eventual result feels hydrating overall. Due to the compact size and flattened shape, these pouches would be great for travel. Especially after a day at the beach!",5
"These nipple covers aren't perfect in every way, but they do offer some reassuring coverage! I do like that they come in 2 different shapes, and I like that they’re super lightweight and easily portable. The satin coverings are soft and smooth, and the light beige hue is an acceptable shade that would complement several skin tones. I will say that the paper backings don’t peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don’t stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I’d have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage. I’ve had no adverse reactions to the adhesive component, they peel off easily, and I even wore a pair while sweating in the summer heat in Texas, and they stayed firmly in place.",4
"This boxed set of smooth, golden eye mask pairs is totally fabulous! Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I’ve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I’ve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I’m thrilled the whole set is so affordable! I couldn’t be more pleased with this product.",5
"This face wash provides an invigorating sense of clean with a burst of fresh citrus zing! I love that it contains aloe vera, vitamin C, rose hip oil, and lemon and orange peels! 🍋 It goes on smoothly, rinses off easily, and seems to have an ideal consistency. I have gladly added this vegan product to my daily skincare regimen, and I’d order it again without hesitation. It provides smoothing, hydrating, radiant results and it smells incredibly delightful!",5
"This is a beautiful and affordably priced facial set! The Brazilian rose quartz stones are a pale shade of pearlescent pink, and the rose gold hardware is the perfect complement to them! The rollers move silently, as promised, and they don’t seem to rust or wear out in any way. The stones are cool to the touch at room temperature, but placing them in the refrigerator (before use) ensures an ultra-chilled experience. I love that the magnetic box lid has instructions printed on the underneath side, and the soft, drawstring pouch is an added bonus! The set even comes with a informational mineral card that provides reassuring details about the quartz pieces featured. Each tool is perfectly nestled within in its own compartmentalized cutout, and the rollers definitely seem to help increase circulation and boost overall skin radiance! This would definitely make a perfect gift set for someone!",5
"I have thick, wavy hair and need a thick brush. Over a decade ago I discovered that boar bristles work best, but finding one I can take with me was a process. I didn't like those with exposed bristles, so there weren't many options. This is the first folding boar-bristle brush I found.<br /><br />The plastic is light and gives the impression that it isn't of the best quality, but it's survived my backpack just fine. This is a portable brush, so using it requires more strokes through my hair, but that's a price I'm not hesitant to pay. It's come in handy for my kids too, who also have the same hair-and-brush combination.",4
Love it,5
This is an amazing contour pallette,5
Works great,5
I've been using this product for over 10 years. Never disappoints.,5
This is a very large and heavy dryer.  I am keeping it as I need one right now but would not buy it again.  Hard to handle.  Certainly too large to travel with.,3
My favorite facial wash!,5
"These are just the right size, and do the job.",5
This's a great product especially if you're lazy like me.,5
eco friendly and very soft,5
good length thick enough to not snap off,5
pompoms are a lil small headband is comfortable,5
"Got this bag to wash the dogs feet in when they come in from outside.<br />So tired of trying to wash them and I've tried the small bucket thing to dip their feet but they don't work cuz their feet are so big, lol.<br />This bag I just fill up and have them walk right in and I clean them up, works great! No water leaks!",5
This nail lamp was bought for myself and the girls when we meet up for beauty time!<br />We keep fighting over who is going to use the lamp next so we decided to get a few of them Lol.<br /><br />Now this one in particular I enjoy using because it dries fast plus I don't feel the heat so much like other lamps. Definitely a good one in my book!,5
This kit comes with everything you need to take off nail polish.<br />This particular set was for my mother in law who is just getting into gel polishes and she didn't understand what the clips were for at first 🤣<br />After I showed her how it took off the polish with scrubbing she was SOOOOO glad I got her this set!,5
"Never tried poly gel before, definitely not easy but worth it! Check out my nails in the photo, came out beautifully and they are very strong!",5
I've had an obsession with gels with my time off from work these past months and I wanted to try this color changing polish.<br />It comes with designs and while the color itself is dark it does change.<br />I am enjoying trying the designs but man it does take practice!!!,5
Great for your pores and acne. My husband's back started breaking out and after using this for a few days it's clearing up and looks less irritated. Plus it came with a bag which I didn't know what for until I read the instructions and it is a foaming bag and it really makes the soap foam!,5
"Made my hair soft again! Not the easiest thing to get on when you have long hair but I managed. Then after the time required I wash my hair and couldn't believe how soft it was. It hasn't been that soft in a long time. So I definitely think it was worth the trouble stuffing all my hair in there and letting it sit plus it doesn't smell the greatest, nor does it smell bad I'm just used to very perfumed shampoos. But I'll definitely be using it again.",5
"I am so glad they made a product like this because I can never seem to find the right color to match my skin and I end up with that Foundation the line on my chin with the two different colors. Not only is this product lightweight, it smells nice, plus it blends in with my skin tone almost perfectly. This is definitely going to be my go to Foundation.",5
Exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you.,5
This is the best thing ever!!!!! I have pain 24/7 and this is awesome!!! I rub this on and the warmth is felt right away! Better than the prescription creams they've given me! I can't sleep without it!!!!,5
Work great.  Fair price.,5
So far this seems to be a good product. It definitely helps rid me of acne scar when used within a combination of other products.,4
My daughter loves the foot pedicure unit.,5
"well, I love the picture!!!!!!!!  granddaughters absconded with them and are very reluctant to share.  I will be buying some more so I can actually hold my hair back.",5
safe step up to whatever you can't reach.  i use it to get into the tub easier.  it is quality built and does the job.,5
I got these because I have tiny wrists and the originals were annoying when I was typing and didn’t have my hair up.  They work just as well and are half the thickness.,5
Great amount of products for the price.  A lot of sample sizes but the value on some of the products is insane.  Loved trying so many things that I wouldn’t consider normally.,5
Honest and True: My husband enjoys keeping is travel items organized and it’s helps me to keep him properly packed. Great travel bag.,5
"Despite having a thick-ish, creamy consistency, the conditioner not only dispenses without issue, its also easy to work into/rinse from hair. Does a nice job of protecting color while detangling and softening. However, I don't really notice any added shine or volume.<br /><br /> I'm beyond thrilled to say it has the unique Moroccanoil product scent that not only smells lovely but actually lasts for a decent amount of time; a rarity with my hair!<br /><br />I love Moroccanoil products and while I do like this, its not my favorite in the line.  I have no plans to purchase this in the future, I'll stick with their hydrating conditioner.<br /><br />Overall score is 3.5 stars",4
"This is a very reasonably priced exfoliator that does a great job of exfoliating and cleansing as well as hydrating and smoothing.  Its packed with antioxidants that are excellent for good skin health.  The instructions says to use 2-4 times a week. I use it twice a week and follow with a good facial moisturizer. I can't say that I experienced a change in my aging skin but I also haven't been using it very long. There is a nice scent that is pretty much gone once the product has been rinsed off.<br /><br />I  have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues using this.",5
"This is an ideal moisturizer for my dry, sensitive, aging skin. It applies easily and absorption is fast. Does a nice job of calming the patches of eczema while moisturizing and firming. I like the ingredients, especially the cactus oil. There is a scent; its a nice scent but it fades quickly. The price is on the high side but worth it.",5
"This is a nice, light gel cream packed with aloe and hyaluronic acid, 2 things I love to use on my dry, sensitive aging skin. Easy to apply-a little goes a long way. Absorption is fast and does not leave a greasy/stick feel behind.  Instantly hydrates and soothes the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself if a light blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it doesn't discolor skin. There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo). Despite this, its still a good, affordable cream that works well on even the driest of skin.",4
"While XXI Bio-Pure facial moisturizer is packed with great skin care ingredients such as jojoba, shea butter, aloe vera, sunflower seed oil and glycerin, I think its the Vitamin C that really makes this an exceptional product.  At least for my skin it's exceptional.<br /><br />This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly and doesn't cause skin to look/feel oily or greasy.  It softens and smooths skin. Fine lines are thinned. My dry, sensitive skin looks and feels refreshed.  And thanks to Vitamin C, my normally dull skin has a dewy glow.  I've not found many products that are able to do this to my skin but XXI does!<br /><br />I have dry , sensitive skin and have no issues with this cream<br /><br />XXI works. It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use.  Results are long lasting.  XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning.  A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face.  Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable. However, if you find this isn't right for you, XXI offers a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. I absolutely recommend XXI Bio-Pure lotion.",5
"""Best shave I've ever had.  Gives me a close shave with no tugging. Better than an electric razor"".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time.  And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold.  The head doesn't pivot  but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn't tip or wobble.<br /><br />He's not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must 'really rub it in' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.  Without a doubt this is worthy of gift giving.  The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Highly recommended",5
"I love how easily and quickly  Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser becomes a creamy lather that feels really nice on my face.  A very small amount of the cleanser does a great job of deeply cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells. My face feels fresh and clean after cleansing. But it does dry out my skin a bit.  Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy. Surprisingly, it doesn't smell like pineapple to me.  It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products. I know pineapple technically isn't a citrus fruit but I was a bit concerned it might be too harsh on my skin. Its not. No burning or itching at all.<br /><br />I like this cleanser a lot. Does a great job, even with drying my skin a bit.  The price is reasonable. This is a cleanser I will continue to use and I recommend it.<br /><br />My overall rating is 4.5 stars.",4
"I LOVE Hask hair products. I'm a huge fan and have been for some time. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash.  But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.  That, along with the great results make the price reasonable. Recommended!",5
"John Frieda's Detox shampoo/conditioner duo is an excellent way to revive and restore hair. The shampoo does a brilliant job of not only cleansing hair, it cleanses the scalp and washes away buildup leaving hair soft and shiny.  The conditioner detangles, hydrates and adds bounce to even the driest hair.<br /><br />Both have a nice scent though it doesn't last long, at least not in my hair!  Each is easy to work into hair and rinse out as well.  I like to use this duo once a week. I experience no color fading or allergic reactions as I have sensitive skin.  Definitely worth the price and absolutely recommended!",5
"I'm so amazed by boar bristle hairbrushes and how incredible they make hair look and feel.  This GAINWELL boar bristle brush is a wonderful, compact brush. It may be small but it works wonders on our family's hair.  It works through tangles without pulling or causing pain while leaving hair soft, shiny and manageable.  The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket.  If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!  If, for some reason you're not satisfied, GAINWELL asks you to contact them for assistance. I can't imagine they receive a ton of calls with issues but its great to know customer service is a  priority!",5
"Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!  I will continue to use/purchase Huxley, I'm that satisfied/impressed with what it does for my skin.  I absolutely recommend Huxley.",5
"I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night.  I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well!  I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience  great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel.  It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin.  The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky.  Fortunately, that's not the case.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately.  I can not only see it but I can feel how it hydrates my skin as well. My skin is normally extremely sensitive and very dry.  The hydration really makes my skin feel great.  I apply the cream at night before bed and enjoy the results in the morning when I awaken.  Lavender is one of my favorite scents.  But I just do not care much for the scent of this cream.  I will not deduct a star from my rating due to the scent...the scent doesn't last long at all.  I don't think its fair to penalize the cream for a scent that doesn't last long.  I have no negative reactions to MU TENUTO. It works and feels great on my sensitive skin.  For those interested in packaging, the jar is glass-nice and heavy with music notes all around it. And here's a neat feature...if you scan the QR code on the package, a snippet of classic music will play on your Smart phone! That's pretty neat.<br /><br />I love what MU  TENUTO does for my skin and works with the very first use!  I find the price reasonable.  This is an excellent cream-it takes wonderful care of my dry, sensitive skin. Definitely recommended!",5
"EXURE is a pretty impressive leave-in conditioner that does a great job of softening and smoothing my hair. Its packed with an impressive array of nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants that protect and heal damaged hair while also adding shine.  I don't need to use very much on my shoulder length hair.  EXURE has a fabulous scent as well.  I don't have any issues with EXURE weighing my hair down or making it look/feel oily or greasy.",4
"Should I start my review by telling you how incredibly creamy Easydew Daily face wash is? How it  makes my skin feel great as I'm washing with Easydew and even better after I've rinsed it off? How much I love the scent?<br /><br />Don't worry, I'll tell you everything! This is  my first ever Easydew product. In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products.  I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!",5
"I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!",5
"The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays. My review will be updated if she has better results than I.<br /><br />--photo #1-taken right after I put some mask on my hand<br />--photo#2-taken after mask sat on my hand for 15 minutes (doesn't dry entirely)",2
"Somehow, I managed to dodge dark circles under my eyes for most of my life...until a few years ago. Now, they're the 'norm' for me.  Same for puffy eyes. FRLEDM's 24K gold under eyes patches help tackle both issues and do so quickly. I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.  I will continue to use the patches and definitely recommend them. I hate to say that I don't recommend the roller just because I don't like the way it feels so I will just say  its not for me.",4
My husband has dry skin that is worsening now that cold weather has arrived and the heat is on in the house on pretty much a regular basis.  I ordered this cream to help moisturize his dry skin as well as  reduce his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'.  He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.  He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy.  He's definitely satisfied with this cream and the results he is receiving thus far.,4
"I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf. It's wonderful",5
"If you're a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol)  I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8""tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog's paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn't thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn't really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won't see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn't enough to clean Mac's muddy/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don't see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer. Perhaps results vary depending on the breed of dog but for our bichon, I really don't see a  difference.",3
"You know the saying 'kill two birds with one stone'? That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!",5
"Boy oh boy, does my dry, sensitive skin LOVE LOVE LOVE Higher Education's Goal Digger cucumber creme!  This is a wonderful  lightweight creme packed with important nutrients such as:  cucumber extract, kale, melon, cabbage, ginger and turmeric, to name a few. Together, these ingredients hydrate and soften skin and do so quickly.  The creme applies nicely -a little goes a LONG way. My skin absorbs it very rapidly and it does not leave a greasy/oily feeling.  It has a nice, light, refreshing  cucumber scent.  This creme will not make your wrinkles and fine lines vanish entirely but  will help visibly reduce them.  If you have dry, sensitive skin you're going to want to try this creme. It will do wonders for your skin!",5
"My feet are so horribly dry and cracked,  they look like funky fish scales.  I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked. They're going to look and feel SO much better after using this treatment!

"A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I'd ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn't take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I'd tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I""m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.  And I WILL continue to use it as needed.  Blonds, if you're dealing with brassy hair, give this mask a try. I hope it works for you as well as it did for me.",5
Very “rusty” color.,4
"Of course, I love Tréstique, but I especially love this lip primer!  It’s not chalky nor sticky, but provides a great priming for Tréstique lipsticks.  I like the primer so much that I purchased them for all of my Tréstique lippies, as opposed to balm that comes with the glosses.  It gives your lipstick longevity and allows for fullest pigment payoff!",5
"Simple, thoughtful design.  Priced right.  I use this to allow brushes to dry after washing.  Works perfectly!",5
"I Love these hats for bedtime, Keeps my hair in place and looks cute. And stays on good. Thank YOU",5
"Try as I might, these clips simply would not stay in my thick hair. They kept slipping and falling out. They are weak and have no grip whatsoever. Others with thinner or finer hair may have better results.",3
"I have very thick hair and when these arrived I attempted to use it to finish a bun. Nope. Thick hair weighs a LOT and this bird nest hair clip just adds more weight and since my bun isn't on top of my head, the clip's weight pushes my bun off the back of my head. I had high hopes for these cute clips, but unfortunately they are a no go for me. I've donated them to my local women's shelter.",2
"I got this KLAVUU Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack and have been using it nightly for a few weeks now. I have found that it is tasteless, odorless and does give me very soft lips by the next morning. However, it is extremely thick and sticky and it doesn't absorb very well. I apply it right before bed and no matter how careful I am to apply a very small amount I always need to use a tissue to dab the excess off so my lips don't stick to my pillowcase and so lint isn't attracted to and stick to my lips while I sleep. So, even though I have soft lips in the A.M., this is a pass for me.",3
"Easy to use, my face was noticeably tighter the next morning and the price is right on point for the pack of 10 that you get. Add to that the scent is not overpowering and there was more than enough serum to get the job done. Thumbs up!",4
"FINALLY!! Hair scrunchies that will not only hold my thick, medium length hair in a ponytail but will also STAY in my hair! I am so tired of scrunchies that fall out of my hair. Seriously. But I got these and they stay put! I am SO happy that I don't have to mess with a falling ponytail all the time anymore! The colors are very nice and the elastic is the best I've ever found in a scrunchie. I will be buying more in other colors!!",5
"The cuticle oil is so very hydrating. My cuticles (both on my feet and hands) are always dry and cracked and this oil really helped them not only look better but feel so much better! I appreciated the easy roll-on applicator too. The body lotion is a decent lotion. I wouldn't say it is earth-shattering or mind-blowing.. but it does smell really good and the scent isn't too overwhelming or powerful. My grandma is sensitive to powerful scents and she didn't turn her nose up at it so there's that. It is a decent thickness (not too runny or too thick), it absorbed relatively quickly and it makes my skin feel soft. The packaging is over the top, in a bad way. As a eco-minded person, the amount of packaging used was just ridiculous and unnecessary, IMO. My experience doesn't justify the price.. for the amounts you get and the average results are not equal to the price paid. Overall, this is a nice set and gift-worthy, but I probably won't purchase it again.",4
"I got this CURECODE serum in hopes of introducing more moisture to my dry face (gotta love winter). The very first thing I noticed was that, while there are directions on the box, there are NO instructions on the bottle itself. I'm not in the habit of keeping the packaging (who does that?!).. they need to add the directions onto the bottle label!<br /><br />The serum itself is pleasing. There was NO scent (THANK YOU!), my sensitive skin had no negative reactions at all and I was pleased with the thickness. It didn't completely absorb into my skin.. I had a few pieces of pillow lint (flannel sheets) stuck to my cheeks the next morning. I can't say how well it works long term yet, but I have high hopes as my skin was more supple the next am. I will update this review if I have any negative reactions.",4
"I purchased this cover January 17, 2011 when I started massage therapy school. I will also mention that when I made my purchase, it was sold as one cover for $8.50. It is a very long lasting cover! Not only did it survive 7 months of use in school, it has been part of my cover collection used for almost 2 years in my practice. It has been laundered and has held up beautifully - no rips, tears, fading or loss of softness. I am considering purchasing more now as my clientele has grown. With the current offer of $32 for a pack of 6, that makes each cover only a little over $5 each. With the track record the one I already have has, I am more than confident in purchasing more!",4
"Love these little glosses! Packaging so cute, and not at all ""gummy"". Feels like a more expensive product.<br />Actually perfect for sharing with my daughter who does not like a lot of color so I take those and she has the neutrals.",5
"I love the dnd product.  I received 2 top coats and two base coats.  Wanted 4 top coats (as advertised).  They were in different bottles than what I've had before.  The top coat is thicker and yellows on my ""White polish"".  Oh well . . .  I don't use white polish often . . .",3
"Love these! The bumps on my legs finally gone! I just use on my arms on legs. Also, a great gift for girlfriends!",4
"Would not spend money again for this product, there are cheaper ones on market that do the same thing. Item just ok.",2
"This is absolutely junk!! The bit won’t even stay in. A total waste of money. Do not buy!,",1
Good product,4
great,5
love this product good price,5
Beautiful as they look hold your hair all day,5
"This product is simply over priced. Have no idea how to use it. Claim to have a video, but the web page cannot be found. Thought the tool was at least a more stronger plastic.this same tool can be found at your local hair store for $.59. Iam returning.",1
I absolutely love ❤️ these 😁 they are nice and heavy stay closed tight great value too!,5
Favorite scent,5
Would buy again.,5
"Good buy. Quality toothbrush. Simple to use, easy to replace the brushes when they wera out. Absolutely no complaints. Would use this vendor in the future.",5
"Nice, tight, assorted colors. Downside: one was broken upon receipt.",4
Great buy at a great price and they were packed great!,5
"Don’t recommend. No your nails don’t look acrylic. Yes they look plastic, thin, and fake.",2
"This is the best dry shampoo I’ve found. Nice light smell, doesn’t dull hair.",5
Smells devine and it's so silky.,5
Too Soft,2
I wish these were still available in multipacks.  They have become really difficult to find.  I love the texture of the gummies and they do not stick to your teeth.,5
Get a great shave with this product and smell good to.,5
they work for my daughter !,4
These blade did not work as well as my other blades,2
under arm deodorant exactly what it is use for,5
"I use one of these bottles for Doterra's OnGuard cleaner concentrate to clean my kitchen. I love it.  It works great and sprays perfectly. The glass seems nice and thick.<br /><br />The other bottle I use for an oil & essential oils mixture for wood polish. Seems to work fine without clogging.<br /><br />Update: These bottles are pretty tough, but still no match for a 3 foot drop to my tile floor. I bought these eight months ago and I like them so much that I'm going to order another set.",5
"It's a little small but works just fine. I was able to fit all my travel sized items in it with no problems, enough for a 10-day trip. Just 4 stars instead of 5 because of its smaller size.",4
[[VIDEOID:52e8d70620797cc4ee762797131ca24c]] These press ons are extremely sturdy! Not flimsy at all. It had just enough flexibility to shape up to fit perfectly! I love them and will be purchasing again! I designed these myself!!,5
I did a quick weave and have had the hair in for two weeks. The hair is really pretty. The only thing is the hair gets nappy near the nape area and once wet the curls do not revert. Would not recommend for long term wear only for an occasion or if you want a quick style. The pic attached is how the hair looks after wetting and detangling also before wetting. I would suggest order longer lengths so you can finger comb instead of actually having to brush the kinks out with the shorter length. It was cute while it lasted though. Remember you get what you pay for! I’m not upset I only needed a quick style so it’s cool.,3
No comment,3
100% happy thank you :-),5
"It's a little... weird... It's the only word I can think of to describe it. It works, and not it pumps up the volume of your hair, but it also adds a great deal of stickiness. Also, it's delivery method is a little odd. Blowing powder into the root of your hair isn't a strange thing per se, but this doesn't seem to deliver it in an even flow. Probably will not purchase again. I love the other Cake products though! The hairspray for example is terrific!",2
Not good,1
"Love, Love Love this brush. Dogs don't mind it and it is so easy to clean with a bush of the button. Highly recommend",5
Smells divine!,5
Was looking for a good shine shampoo and conditioner.  This did exactly the opposite.  Made my hair super dry and dull.,2
Either my head is too small or these are HUGE.... They fall off after a few minutes of low intensity activity 😒,1
I don’t like them at all they stretch but I would say a little too much... They don’t stay to the hair... I wouldn’t recommend,2
"I love these eyelashes. I especially love that they offer the eyeliner in brown, black and clear. It's also great that I can wear my favorite eyelashes that normally require glue with this eyeliner without the need of glue. The eyelashes included in the kit are a good everyday eyelash. I also like that I can purchase their eyeliner separately if I want instead of having to buy the kit again. I've worn these lashes all day and even slept in them a night or two just to see how well they'd hold up. They held up amazingly. I've purchased an additional black and clear eyeliner to go with my kit. I prefer these over the magnetic eyeliner with magnetic lashes because it concerns me that the magnetic eyeliner may be found to have adverse effects at some point. Oh, additionally, this eyeliner goes on so well as a good as the adhesive works with the lashes it doesn't have a tacky feeling on your eye. With the exception of the eyeliner holding the lashes in so well, you'd never know it has an adhesive to it. This is my absolute favorite lash kit ever. It's worth the money. You won't regret this purchase.",5
Linestone lost.,2
Nice little kit for the price. I don't believe it's a quarter jaw...too big.,3
The pattern was excellent. The elastic used to make cap stay on the head should be covered . It fit well but irritated the scalp around the hairline.,4
Worth the money and very comfortable,5
The only mousse I've ever used that really gives my fine hair volume as promised. Have used it for years and won't use anything else because there's no point.,5
Makes perfect curls. You can go spiral or just wavy. Saves me alot of money on a perm cause now i can go strait or curly.,5
"I love this! Usually these are about $5 each, this is a wonderful price for the amount you get",5
Smells so nice and my hair quality enjoys these too.,5
Thick gel that helps your hair look fabulous while holding it in place.,5
GREAT PRODUCT!! GREAT PRICE!!!,5
"The colors are great, the price is out of this world!! I now have a color for any outfit!!",5
Great with the Halloween display.,5
Ehh.  Foil with soaked cotton balls accomplished the same and have a more secure grip.,3
"I actually like the way this one sprays better than CT.  Lasts just as long, totally impressed.  I got 3 bottles for less than 1 CT.  I’m sold!",5
"It makes my eyelashes a lot longer, saving me from having to wear falsies all the time.  It is waterproof, but it is a little difficult to take off.  I have tried all kinds of remover.  The best way I found is to put a warm washcloth over my eyes for a few minutes and then try to remove with makeup remover.  It is a bit wet when you first get it, so you really have to drag off the excess before applying.  After a few weeks, it is easier to apply.  It is still better than any mascara I have used.",5
I like creams better because they are easier to blend.  Once you put this on it stays for sure but I wanted a  little more play to blend.  It needs a view more colors like pink and green to help Camo then it would be even better,3
Sorta dumb looking for a woman my age.,3
I gave this to my son for Christmas and he really seemed to like it!,5
I really like these. I love that I got 2. I put one in our camper for camping trips and the other one is in my bathroom. I use it daily!,5
Love this conditioner! Makes my hair soft and tangle free!,5
Love this product,5
"Love love love this eye shadow.  It is nice to find a company that does what it says.  Now I am a very seasoned, long timer eye shadow wearer so my cabinet is full of tried and not true eye shadows.  This company is perfection.  This eye shadow is a definite for sensitive eyes.  It is soft, smooth, and long lasting.  The color scheme it current with fashion.  And the price is fabulous.",5
Beautiful colors perfect for evening.  Green eyes really pop,5
These fall apart easily,2
A lil runny but works well,5
Helped my nails,5
They chose the colors so some might not be what you want but my daughter's did.,4
The color was pretty but they were frizzy,1
"A little bigger then the last pair I bought from Amazon and just as sharp, pleased.",5
"Very smooth, blends well",5
Chose warm vanilla and the fragrance is wonderful but it did not last not last 72 hrs.<br />The product is too creamy and never dried on my skin.<br />It didn't prevent wetness or odor so was a total waste especially the $17 I foolishly paid for it.,1
This is only good for super dry skin. It makes my skin super oily and shiny and it doesn’t feel so good and it’s not very breathable,2
This is probably only good for extremely oily hair and probably oily hair would have a problem with it. It dries my hair so much I have to use a second conditioner to make my hair feel ok,2
The packaging is cute and it’s easy to use. It feels good when I apply it. But there’s really no result from using it. The price is very high and I wouldn’t buy it again,2
I don’t like the texture of it and it has this shimmering things in it which is weird. And it doesn’t do anything for my eyes,2
It’s easy to use and but a little hard to absorb. There’s no scent and one bottle will last a long time,3
This set is perfect for Christmas season! It can be good for your female friends. If contains a great combo of stuff like tumbler and candles. The design is great!,5
The bar soap is extremely expensive and it doesn’t worth the price. It’s very small and will probably only last two weeks top if you use it every day. The scent is very strong and disgusting,1
I don’t see any result from using this. And they shouldn’t sell it for money as this is supposed to be a free sample,2
Use this stuff a lot - always ordering more as I use it frequently.,5
"well made, looks great, priced right",5
My pets don’t mind this brush because it’s gentle. Works well and easy to clean. Recommend,5
"These caps are very small. Even though my hair length is short, the cap barely covers my head. If I had hair longer than my collar, it wouldn't fit at all.",3
This product is great. It is easy to use and lasts about 4 weeks. I highly recommend it.,5
My 15-year-old daughter loved these. It didn’t take long to get here and it has everything she needed to give herself a beautiful manicure. Would definitely buy it again.,5
Use this everyday !,5
"I get so much compliments every time i wear one of these hair clips. it is very sturdy. I was pleasantly surprised. Just wished it came in a storage case and not plastic bags. However, this can be corrected by buying a small storage case for it",5
The 'mix' is more clear than red. The glitter is too big to be in a nail polish.,2
"This topper is comparable to one for $9.99 on the Asian websites.  The color is fake, the hair is fake, and it’s not worth a tenth of what was charged.  Don’t waste ur time😡",1
I had ordered for a fair complexion and was sent make up to make me look black and white ...  no tones...no colors.,3
Works well,5
"The smell is wicked, not a smooth powder",1
Hard plastic pinches sides of face,2
"I have bought this for years, it works fantastically in a foaming dispenser.  I keep one by my kitchen sink to use when I am cooking and messing with raw meat. It also helps remove odors. Since Covid19 I use it to wash my hands, arms and face before going out. I originally came across this when I had surgery ( I had to wash with it the night before and the day of with it) I also got a friend to start using it for diabetic foot care. It kills off fungus so helps prevent cracks and infection.",5
"This thing works GREAT considering how inexpensive it was. It's quite loud at full power, but you can adjust the speed up and down depending on your needs. Most importantly, it effectively sucks in dust when you file over it, helping to keep down the scattering of nail dust all over yourself, your clothes, your work surface, etc.",5
"Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.<br /><br />Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.",4
"This is a light cream that makes your skin feel so smooth and yummy. There is a faint citrus smell. It does seem to make the skin &#34;ready to go&#34; in the morning, so what i mean is that i seem to look less droopy in the morning. Recommended night creme.",5
"THIS STUFF 👌🏻 I was told this would help my glitter and face gems stay on my face at festivals. I tried it out by using it before a terribly hot and humid concert, followed by a metal show after that. By the end of the night, my hair and shirt was drenched from sweat, but my eye makeup was hardly messed up. Very impressed so far.",5
These looked great on my friend and stayed on the entire night,5
I was going to return one but it takes 6 to 8 weeks to notice a difference and I do want to have Fuller eyelashes and eyebrows so I'm going to give it a chance even though it was a little pricey my eyelashes deserve it,5
Great jewelery. If there is an issue the company is on it and correcting it right away.,4
I was hoping that it was going to be like the redkin spray and it is not.,2
Doesn't last,2
"These were purchased das a gift, so cannot review how well they work, but seem to be very good quality and the case is beautiful.",4
Works good,3
Really like this eyebrow gel. The color is a perfect match.,5
"Betty Dain has been around forever. The length of time in the business speaks for itself.<br />This company always delivers just what I ordered, no hidden costs. Good quality items and fast shipping.<br />Only one thing I would change is I would replace velcro with snaps and not raise the price.",5
My daughter loves these but it's too greasy for me.,1
"Shipped and arrived when expected, is what its supposed to be, does exactly what it should, no complaints.",5
Crappy & unusable.,1
"I needed a brown for nail art.  I really only care for polishes with holo in them.  It is a pretty color.  But it's pretty thin, takes about 3 coats for opacity and the holo is very scattered and barely visible.  I think i'm going to try an indy brand and see if I can find a better holo.  Don't get me wrong, if you are looking for regular polish with that little something extra,  this is a great polish.  If you're looking for an amazing holographic polish that happens to be brown,  meh,  this isn't it.<br />Arrived quickly,  in excellent packaging.  Protected by bubble wrap and bubble mailer. Excellent seller.",5
"It dries quickly,  cleanly.  It is holo...what more could you possibly want from a top coat?",5
Didn't do much for me. Had used other product but Amazon quit selling and that worked.,1
Cheap and breaks easy,1
great,5
"These scissors are no where near sharp enough to adequately cut hair.  They are a heavier scissor that maybe could be sharpened, but why are they sold so dull? I have had little to no use for them.",2
"I normally use another brand of Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner, but due to it being so pricey, I was looking for an alternative.  This one does a good job of cleaning and conditioning your hair, but with my other one I can run a comb through my long hair after using it, which I could not do with this one.  It still gave my hair a smooth texture and softness after using it, so I would recommend it to anyone that has never used Argan Oil products before.  I just got spoiled by my hairdresser with the expensive one first.",3
Perfect and handy,5
The best powder I have used.,5
"I used to use this all the time, but somehow forgot about it.  Now i don't have to use detangling spray any longer.  I absolutely love this stuff.  Fantastic price",5
Item perfect...soft...buttons in right place....,5
Gives moderate pain relief and the texture and scent are nice.,4
It works! I had some veins in my legs lasered and got huge bruises.  This cream got rid of the bruises is record time and calmed down the pain.,5
Great for my Dalmation themed Kindergarten.,5
Really cut. I take off pendant for different look.,5
Really a good product and I'm very happy that it can now be purchased through Amazon.,5
"What I don't like the next day my hair doesn't feel soft as some moisturizers. I'm sure it's because it isn't oily or greasy, which I like. Maybe adding a little oil to help maintain softness.",5
The compartments could be deeper to hold the Naked pallets I own.,3
Love it. Gel even works on regular polish.,5
I was really impressed with how nice these are for the price.  They do just as great as my $25 pair.,5
"I purchased these for a party I was going to. Most of the people attended had actual large tattoo's - these were good enough to be believable at first sight (but yeah, you won't fool anyone for long). The colors were nice and vibrant, They went on nicely and they stuck! I had to scrub quite a bit to get these off (hint - use a washcloth you don't care about too much, I could never get the gunk off my washcloth). If you're looking for something that is somewhat realistic looking and has some lasting power - these are great.",5
I like their volumizing 2in1 better,3
"Great product, gives the air a fresh clean scent",5
works as expected,5
The best hair spray ever!!!,5
"great colors, every compliments the shades",5
This has a lot of glitter and is applied easily! Perfect with every outfit because it is multicolored!,5
connectors work great.  wish they were a little bigger,5
"I don't know what I did without this brush before. I have naturally dark hair that I have colored blonde so my hair is dry, brittle and tangles very easily. Before I had to use nearly an entire bottle of conditioner just to make my hair manageable post shower. Now I barely use any conditioner. I use a detangling / leave-in conditioner spray (Unite 7 Seconds is awesome by the way) and then I brush through with this brush and it goes through without ripping out my hair and getting stuck. It's not fancy, and arrived with the black logo on the back nearly scratched off but who cares - it works.",5
"Damn thing works. I have a very curly beard and it reallybstraightens it out. I think it might be damaging to your hair if you use it alot, so caveat emptor.<br />Definitely works, though.",4
Love it,5
"I bought seven of these. Took them to a party. They all fell apart within minutes. Terrible product. I barely had mine on and walked across the room when the strands started dropping all over the floor. The next day, they were found in the bathroom, under the couch, ....and this was an alcohol free anniversary party. Come on.  Do not bother.",1
"This mitt is so large that you really have to use a lot of pressure when rubbing on your tanning lotion to keep the mitt from sliding off your hand, which then causes the foam on the inside of the mitt to rip and tear quickly. This happened to me and the tanning lotion leaked through and I had orange fingers and palms for days.",1
Completely stunning lashes. The BEST I've ever worn. I will continue to repurchase forever,5
I just love these refreshing masks!,5
Makes my homemade manicure hard as a rock in no time flat!  Can't imagine doing my nails without it!!,5
"So many things wrong; where to start.  First of all, the image portrays a nice silicon object that fits over your toe and provides both the toe separator AND cushioning for a bunion.<br /><br />The toe separator piece is HUGE and uncomfortable.  The silicon bit that is SUPPOSED to provide cushioning just flaps around even with socks.  It is very bulky as well.<br /><br />IF you choose to order one of these, many of these are being sold on Amazon from sellers based in China.  A giveaway is the 2-3 week shipping time.",2
Takes at least two coats for good coverage and will eventually smudge off after moderate touching. If left alone (no kissing!) it can last a while but there's nothing really standout about this product except for maybe the scent/taste which is a decent chocolate scent that lasts a short time. The matte finish looks nice but there's little to recommend about this product there's better out there.,3
"Everyone knows the saying ""Don't put anything in your ear smaller than your elbow."" but we all use cotton buds to clean out our ears. Just about every one of these came apart. One I had to have a friend pull out with a pair of tweezers. I was just glad she was home. Years ago they used to make cotton buds with wooden sticks. There was a good reason they stopped and went to a more flexible and softer cardboard. I think these aren't the safest cotton buds on the market. I really don't like these buds, they come apart, the wood doesn't flex and is thin and almost pointy. Not a fan.",2
"I tried this every day for a couple weeks. I stored it in the fridge and went over my face with decent pressure. Didn't seem to do anything? I mean the cold jade feels okay, even nice, against the skin but I didn't see any real benefit. Maybe it needs more time? I'm not sure. . .",3
"Noisy, can't really heat the water, barely keeps it warm. But the absolute worst part of this foot bath are the rollers that are supposed to massage your feet. These things are HARD plastic and actually are sharp in places. I tried them for a few seconds then tore them out and throw them away. They HURT badly. Who could design such a thing? the catches the rollers mounted in are not much better as they stand, sharp and hard, into your feet. I guess you could cut those out, maybe, but this thing isn't worth the time or effort. Look elsewhere for your foot care needs this painful thing isn't the one.",1
"Smooths out the skin, makeup stays on longer.<br />I would not be without Mehron",5
"I've had this model trimmer for about 2 years now.  At first, it was pretty good value for light trimming.  But the trimmer guard is a flimsy plastic piece that easily breaks and it's difficult to find a replacement trimmer guard (no results from the Remington website) for this model.  As well, the NiMH battery is pretty pathetic, not only short lasting when it is brand new and fully-charged, but NiMH battery tech has a terrible lifespan.  Why any manufacturer would use it in this day and age baffles me. Unless it was about planned obsolescence all along. Overall, this is an attractive product for light trimming and delivers somewhat, for awhile, until one of the cheap components fails and you have to buy another because the battery is not replaceable nor is the guard made to last.",3
My favorite scent of the group. Cleans your beard great and smell is delightful,5
"Amazing, sums it up.. doesnt dry your beard out. Cleans it and smells wonderful. Great price and lasts me rougjly a month",5
"Smells nice, works great, price is just right",4
Cleans beard and smells amazing,5
Smells amazing. Doesn't seem to dry my skin. You know it's getting where it needs to go as it's not long before you taste it,5
"Like the title say, if you have bangs that come to your  brows or sweep across your brows in any way… it will rub off. Will be returning… ugh",2
"The brush is really nice, good craftsmanship with a thick substantial handle.  It deserves to be loved, but only if you're right-handed.  The way the bristles are angled makes the brush upside-down in a left hand.  Sure, you can use the long bristles, but that defeats the purpose of the angle which really does make the brush go through whiskers more easily.  We Southpaws are very used to this.  So many products designed to fit in a hand are made for the right hand, which makes them awkward or ineffective (like scissors) for 10% of us.  When that happens, I find that I don't reach for that item as often, or I avoid it altogether, and, sadly, this fine brush sits seldom-used in my bathroom.  Maybe some future version could have the peak of the bristles in the middle with an angle on both sides.  You vast-majority-of-right-handers will love this brush.",3
Same classic filled chocolate cake snack.  Tasty but a bit dry.,4
great to clean mask and other devices. saves us a lot of $ and keeps things clean.,5
Brush stiffer than expected.,4
It was very painful to use! It pulled and tugged and left me raw! I couldn't use it but a minute! It didn't do a good job. I returned it!,1
I bought this for my son as his hair is thinning. I don't know yet how well this is helping . He did say the smell is awesome. He really likes it,4
Super cute! Love the mirror inside.,5
Easy to install and remove,5
Love the hair,4
"This is exactly what I needed. I have been pouring mouthwash out of 1.5L bottles for years, and this pump provides a consistent, metered amount, and prevents waste. I use two full pumps to provide enough mouthwash for a proper rinse, and some people might even want three (one is definitely not enough). Works perfectly, fits perfectly, and is exactly what I wanted. Best $7 I have spent in ages. :)",5
It's ok hard to use because it is very stiff and hard to put tips in( they won't stay in),3
"Can barley pick up any eye shadow, they are so small , I threw them out",5
"Worked pretty well, no complaints",4
"I am highly allergic to formaldehyde,  it cause me to be dizzy. Have headaches,  watering eyes. Sore throat. I had all these things after using this hair condition one time. I read the remarks, and another person asked Amazon if there was formaldehyde in it, and they referred this person to the manufacturer. Located in Hong Kong,  they gave the person the run around on the answer. And never did admit it. It is illegal to put it into anything here in the US. I was exposed to it through 2 different sets of sheets and one face cream. And now this hair conditioner. Ive contacted the manufacturer,  but I doubt I'll hear from them!!",1
I was allergic to something in it.,2
They work great especially for cleaning eye makeup brushes. Great gifts too.,4
This is so very good for my hair,5
"So good for our hair, will purchase again",5
"It's crazy that items like these are essential now, but they are very needed. These little straps hold up well and they dont have issues of fraying mask fabric or make it difficult to remove the mask. These work very well to save your ears and make it easier to use masks for little ones that are a little too large for them.<br />Thank you for these!",5
"I was really hoping I snagged a good one but this one is off the mark a bit. The blades tend to snag a little bit when cutting the hairs so it pulls a little when it cuts. I also found that it doesn't contour to the face all that well even though it has the ability to flex the blades. It also just comes with a USB cord and no plug so you have to hunt around for a plug to use. I didn't get to test the battery life as I only used it once and my face was as shaved as it was going to be with this razor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not great. It does do an ok job and if it's set within your means, it will work for the time being.",2
Works very well and easy to use.,5
Works great.,5
They were nice. Not as bedazzled as I thought..,4
Use it everyday! A necessity for my hair routine. Holds well without greasy feeling or flaking. Wife and daughter use it on fly always and for hold too. Smell is great and container looks cool.,5
I looked at other products and so decided to get this one. I wanted to try it and it works. Airassi is a product I never heard of but reading other very good reviews I wanted to try it. It has a Hair Inhibitor. Plus if you have any question to concerns you can email mail them for support.,5
"I bought them as a gift, but they smelled nice and the box looked great. The box could use a better cardboard, since the shipping can be rough and it had a slight dent on the side which I was able to push out. I'm glad it wasn't too bad, so I was still able to gift the box.",4
My favorite.,5
Works great. Shaves easily.,5
"My hair is thick but fine.  These clips do not hold my hair in place, they slide down significantly.  The selection is as shown, quality ok, but they don't work for me.",3
Great product.  Have purchased before.  Will continue to purchase.,5
"Keep in mind this is a thin piece. But all I wanted was something to transition and cover my frizzy new baby hairs on the crown of my head to the rest of my hair while it grows. This would’ve been perfect,  But the color was several shades off.",2
I would not recommend this comb. It smells awful! You cannot use on wet hair or get it wet.,1
A great face mask for dry weather - my favorite ones on Amazon! Makes your skin feel so soft.,5
Beautiful. Long lasting.,5
Too big. No good directions,1
Too thick to get sparse spots.,2
The bristles are ok. The round ones are a little hard to hold. But for the price they are fantastic.,4
"If you open them up slightly they can be used on your hands. I mainly got them for my tablet and phone screens, but apparently there is something in them that smears. I thought they were just alcohol and water. They're OK, but nothing to write home about for my purposes. However, I'm sure they will work fine for someone who must clean off a wound or prepare a spot for an injection.",3
Absolutely love how easy these are to use.  They absorb water well and the button to secure it works great.,5
"After using the serum almost a month, myself and others noticed a huge difference in the look, feel and luster of my dull, dry lifeless looking hair. I am glad I strayed from my usual routines of conditioners, hot oil treatments, you name it! I have combo hair/dry last 3/4 parts, with oily scalp. Olio & Crema serum helped moisture lock the dry without affecting or worsening my scalp oil amount! Happy!",5
"At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as ""Frenzy"" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007",2
We like this product very much,5
These are one of the best make-up removers!!!!,5
I use this as a refill replacement on my heat embossing pad....works great!,5
"It works ok. On my mother it is very noticeable. On myself, not much of a difference at all. Probably will not buy again. I will purchase a different product from this company but probably not this particular item.",3
Great product! A super mascara.,5
Did not work well on dark hair.  Bought to use on dog and didn't show bvb up at all.  Did not show up on daughter's hair as well.,1
"i have been using rice paper blotters for about 5 years, and I am hooked on them, however sometimes it is difficult to find except on line.  this type is really quite good- really absorbs oil on your face and leaves a light but invisible powder on your face which make it look like you've just washed, moisturized and put fresh make up on. The booklets are smaller than a credit card size and you can use these very discreetly, while at dinner or cocktails etc. No need to go to a restroom to re-apply make up. Really good in hot sunny weather when oils really  pour out of your face.<br /><br />My friends marvel at the results when they see me tear out this little piece of paper and gently pat my oily face.  I have had to order for several of them.<br /><br /> I have several booklets which I keeps handy - one in the car, in a few handbags. Note - make sure you get the right shade -  I am darked skinned - the Rachel is perfect.  Rose is for fair or light skinned complexsions.<br /><br />Great buy!!",5
Just what we were looking for,5
Favorite toothbrushes ever. Order every time we need some! Packs of 4!,5
Love these toothbrushes!,5
This stuff smells. A lot. And it lingers for hours. I actually ended up washing my face all over again to get it off before going to sleep.<br /><br />The lotion itself is smooth and didn't irritate my skin. It seems to absorb reasonably fast as well. But....that awful smell is a deal breaker for me.,3
I don't really have any use for the gloves included in this set. The curry comb is what I wanted. It works like it should and removes excess hair without pinching. Our donkey seems to really prefer a curry comb to any other type of brush and he likes this one.,4
"I've been using this on my feet rather than my face. It's just too heavy and thick for a face cream. After 4 days, my heels are definitely softer.<br /><br />It seems to absorb reasonably quickly, but slower than my usual moisturizer and skin cream. I can't detect any perfumes in this and that's definitely good.",4
"Good grief.  If you have thick, long hair,  avoid these. The decorative bead things catch my hair and pull. Not cool. There is also less stretch and elasticity in these than with regular scrunchies- with thick hair that means these won't last long. Perhaps if your hair is very fine or very short you can make these work,  but I can't stand them.",2
"Between regular,  every day germs and now Covid-19, we go through a bunch of sanitizer. It's in the cars, the house, the horse barn and luggage. We tend to use Purell in the giant wall dispensers in the house and barn, but these big bottles are nice too.<br /><br />The sanitizer smells like what it is. This seems a bit thinner than the Purell, but dries quickly enough. I haven't noticed any sticky residue left behind or excessive drying of our skin. I'm taking one of these with me to West Texas tomorrow for use in the truck and cabin. It fits nicely in my overnight bag pocket.",5
"Wipes like this are a fill in for actually washing your face with real soap and water,  but they do come in handy sometimes.  I was using these after working horses and shoveling stalls. The wipes are thick enough to get the grime off without tearing. However, after three days, my face broke out in two spots! My friend tried them and after three days, she says she's fine. So it's just me I guess.",3
"I have very thick, very long hair and I work with horses and dogs daily. That means I've got a pony tail every day with a scrunchie. This one is a pretty deep green and it holds my thick hair well. The silk doesn't create friction or split ends and that's good. However, you only get one of these for the price and that is just ridiculous. This thing is no different from any other scrunchie out there except for the silk fabric and that still doesn't make it worth fifteen bucks.",3
"As much as I hate to admit it, getting close to 50 brings lots of unpleasant changes and some great ones. One of the ridiculous things is suddenly discovering random hairs on my face. Tweezing is certainly effective, but takes forever and is tiresome.<br /><br />This is the first little shaver of this type I've used. It needs a single AA battery that is not included. It's reasonably quiet when running, has a little light and is easy to hold. It is completely painless as advertised - this actually shaves rather than ripping hair out like those epilator things. It works well and I don't really have any complaints.",4
"I'm not a big believer in all the hocus pocus claims made by every single women's skin care product on the market. They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer. So....four star rating for no negative reaction and for being a nice enough moisturizer requiring very little product.",4
I use this in rotation with a couple of other brands. The scent is pretty mild and it lathers richly and my hair does feel nice and clean and soft after using this for a few days. But....there can definitely be a build up if I use it for a week straight. My hair is long and very thick and after a week with this shampoo & matching conditioner I find my hair looks weighed down and flat.,4
Performance  only fair. Must use a great deal of product to hold hair in place & the hold doesn't last; inferior  to Aussie Freeze aerosol.,3
Smells very good,5
"I wanted to try the breathable nail polish. I prefer frosts or pearls, and pinks. My favorite polish is by another company in a rose gold.<br /><br />The photos included for this polish clearly look rose gold. Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I've already opened it, I can't return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is ""Pinky Promise"", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to ""Purple Promise"", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the ""breathable"" polish, as I'd never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish. It was still going strong, no chips or flaking, four days later.<br />Until I did a big batch of dishes.<br />I usually wear gloves to wash dishes (yes, sadly, we have no dishwasher where we live. It's like the 1950's). However, I wanted to test the polish, so wore my usual glove on my right hand, and no glove on the left.<br />Water, for prolonged time, is this polish's kryptonite! I added a photo. All the polish came off the ends when my nails got super wet and soft.<br />But I will say the polish lasted much longer than my usual brand (Hansens).",3
"Well, I am not sure why someone would want this particular hair piece.<br />It is ok, and the hair feels very slick. But you only get ONE piece, so it would not be enough for most hairstyles.<br /><br />I misplaced my photos, but will add them when I find them.<br />It is just super important to realize you do not get a whole hairpiece, but just one small clip's worth of hair. To look like the vendor photo, you would need to buy 10-12 of these.",4
"We do not currently have any dogs, only cats. But, thought I would give this one a try.<br /><br />It does a good job, but is a little large for an average cat. Ours were highly suspicious of it as well, being creatures of habit and used to their other brush! Ha!<br /><br />Nice quality, but would definitely recommend it for dogs more than cats.",4
"This hair has a very interesting texture.. it is soft to the touch, yet simultaneously has a rough texture. It is not like baby fine hair, it is like thick, slightly frizzy hair.<br /><br />There is not a whole lot of shine to this faux hair, although the flash on my camera added some.<br /><br />You get a generous six packages of hair. There is not a large amout of hair in each package, but it is long enough to be versatile.<br />Please note I do not wear this type of hair - I use them for craft purposes. I was happy with both the texture and the color of this batch.",4
"This has a nice texture to it. The faux hair is nice and thick, and you get plenty of it. This would be very useful for wigs and hairpieces. I plan to use it for craft purposes.",5
I really like how firm it is. It has all the essentials.,5
"Great powder, have been using this brand for a decade & the clear complexion powder is hard to find in my shade in stores recently . Great buy",4
"Wore for my wedding, didn't bug my skin, but came off quick in the heat!",3
"I've been using 5-day Deodorant for years -- the original liquid one with the little pads that you apply directly.  I'm sensitive to some deodorants, but I've never had any problems with this brand.  I decided to give this roll-on a try, and find it works exactly the same as the liquid/pad version.<br /><br />I put it on after I shower and just forget about it.  Although the label says &#34;regular scent,&#34; there's really almost no scent at all -- I'm really REALLY sensitive to scents, and I get no irritation/scratchy throat/etc. from this.  It isn't the cheapest option out there, but I can't find it in the local stores anymore, so ordering online is the only way I can get it.  It's worth it to me.  Will continue to order and use as long as it's available.",5
"I do a lot of crafts -- especially paper crafts -- and have several versions of similar boxes filled with small flowers, embellishments, etc.<br /><br />This one stands apart from the rest.  It's VERY durable -- the bottom is ""frosted,"" the top is clear; the lid fits tightly onto the bottom and also sits flush against the compartments without any gaps at all; and the clasp is tight fitting and solid.<br /><br />I love the adjustable aspect of this.  The ""row height"" is fixed at about 1 1/8"", but the ""cell width"" is totally adjustable by moving the plastic tabs around.  The tabs move easily and seat securely, making reconfiguring a piece of cake.<br /><br />All of this versatility combines to make this incredibly useful for paper crafters.  I've loaded mine with a collection of sequins, brads, eyelets, and flat-backed ""gemstones.""  I've shaken it and dropped it, and not a single sequin is out of its compartment.  That's a precision fit!<br /><br />Very pleasantly surprised by this item -- I was NOT expecting the level of quality here.  I'm probably going to be purchasing several of these to replace some of my existing boxes -- they're that good!<br />(Sample provided for review; opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with this item.)",5
"I am very skeptical regarding the claims made on the box. On the front of the box they claim the cloths are ""designed to reduce fine lines & wrinkles."" This claim is absolute nonsense. The box also states that the face towel is ""A 100% handmade silk face towel."". This is false. The underside of the cloth is 50% cotton. They should put this info on the box itself, but they don't. It's misleading and diminishes their credibility.<br /><br />The box claims that this cloth can brighten dull & uneven skin. I am skeptical this cloth has special powers that can do this on its own.<br /><br />Save your money and do not spend so much for just 2 cloths that are not even 100% silk. These cloths do not offer the equivalent value for what is being charged.",1
I have the Granite and the Plain. Definitely go for the Granite. The Plain will show white specks and other crap very easily. The Steel Granite color will not.<br /><br />These mats are truly the best. So comfortable and nice. I highly recommend the WellnessMats Granite in the Steel color. You will not be sorry.,5
"I found nothing to dislike about this product. It serves its purpose, for those facilities that hand soap is not present. Great rose scent.",5
Looked as cheap as it was you get what you pay for. I sent it back.,1
Holds hair well in all weather not sticky and does not have overpowering scent,5
"Very weak and poorly made- wasn’t strong enough to cut my acrylic nails- completely broke in half the 2nd time I used it- then, when I tried just using the trimmers instead- THEY BROKE IN HALF TOO! THIS IS AN INFERIOR PRODUCT!!! DO NOT BUY!!",1
Love these!,5
Only 2 colors in the variety box and both are shades of red.,1
"I agree it's very heavy and the size of a 3/4 full head hair extension but i am going to try and cut half of it off and if that doesn't work i'll throw it out.  I also agree that VELCRO that is on the wrap part, my hair gets stuck in it.  I think this hair thingie has potential, ya just gotta figure it out.  (:",4
"These brushes give a good massage while washing my hair.  Would be great for dog baths. Soft, but sturdy.  Come packed in a 2 bag sales unit.<br /><br />Update, 3/15; when pressing too hard, the brush does come apart.  It is a 3-piece brush, and the handle does not stay attached while using, and the middle nub brush section pushes in and comes apart.  I Will need to look for a solid unit if available.",2
"Product matched description, ease of purchase, quick delivery<br />Will recommend to all of my family and friends",5
"I use homemade soap and bought these little sacks to make using my soap more convenient!  I love all the lather they produce and have given a few away with bars of my soap and the recipients loved them, as well.  I tie a loose knot in the top and when the soap runs out, I let the ribbon dry, undo the knot, load with new soap and it works perfectly. Great buy, great product!",5
"This definitely works the best. I have tried every nail Hardner on the market, I have even taken hair skin and nail vitamins which did not work. My nails are beautiful now, longer, harder.  I do not go to the salon, I do my own nails, I use Color Street nail stickers.  I have used Color Street for three years now and every morning I put a fresh coat of this nail Hardner on and my manicure stays intact for three weeks, and no, I don’t have a dishwasher, so I’m doing dishes and cleaning and my nails still look beautiful. 😀 I get compliments all the time.",5
No dif than all other clear coats,3
nozzle wont work but did LEAK laying down,1
Hate gloves idea - i use product in shower because of dye risk on surfaces- left on 5 mins but hair showed zero result,2
My hair is picky - But this gives me HEALTHY HAIR!,5
way too yellow and not as wrinkle friendly or moist,2
I agree 100% with previous review. Exactly what I was about to say. I found this at TJMAXX and bought it to use on chest - to save more expensive small bottle retinol's for neck/face.  Now I put it under eyes and on neck in the AM...Saving Retinol for use only at night. I will check at store to repurchase - I hate shipping chrgs. (Amazon doesnt stock much so we have to pay to ship?? No thanks),5
Stays put and great quality! Being a huge lipstick fan I find this better than many expensive brands!,5
"Good price, pretty patterns and comfortable",5
"Excellent product, I just love it and so my skin, thank you",5
"This is a new product for me, I like the blue color, goes on smoothly with finger or Q-tip, etc.  Will probably buy blue alone next time. Don't need other colors.",5
Other canned bean sprouts I bought had no label distinction between soy and mung bean sprouts.  It was reassuring to be able to avoid soy.,4
"Works great, but be careful, the clippers are very sharp.",5
"I love this soap so much. I use it for my body in the shower. It doesn't dry out my sensitive skin, it's scent is really pleasant and not strong, and it seems to last a while. Definitely will continue to purchase this soap and it's worth paying $12-13 for three bars in my opinion.",5
Excellent product,5
I love this little pack of tweezers. I can carry it in my backpack and always have it. The tweezers themselves are good quality and fairly heavy duty. I also really like the cat on the front lol<br /><br />Happy customer,5
"Kinda small, and tight, they pull my hair out.",4
I love the color. I have hazel eyes that change colors and this brings out the green in my eyes.  It could wear a little longer and seems to fade just enough to where i feel like i need to touch it up.,5
To greasy.....got returned,1
Wish they was bigger,5
"This did not come in a box (I've had one before, they definitely are supposed to be boxed) and the sound that is supposed to beep at 30 seconds is broken. No. Would not reccomend.",2
Pro:<br />My cat adores this thing. He bugs me to brush him with it every night. He tries to climb onto my nightstand to remind me.<br /><br />Con: it doesn’t hold a candle to the amount of hair I get off him using my Hartz Groomer's Best Small Slicker Brush. The hair’s also much harder to get out of the brush than with the Hartz one.,5
These are just small basic scrunchies but definitely worth the price for so many of them my daughter loves them,5
Love love love this nail polish ! Super easy to use and exactly like the picture ... will be buying in every color ! Sooooo cool !,5
"Has made bathing our 3 pound shih tzu A LOT easier. We use these bottles to store diluted mixes of shampoo and conditioner in water, and allows us apply more controlled amounts of each product!",5
"Love the case, the color and works well just like the gritty emery board.",5
I used these to hold a head piece on. They’re fabulous as they don’t tear or grip too tightly.,5
"Awful.<br />The brushes from a dollar store, are much better.<br />I waited too long, to return.",1
"#21 light neutral beige, and it is a pretty good match to my fair, cool skin.<br /><br />My skin: fair, dry, mid 40s, pink cheeks from Rosacea (visible veins, zero acne). I find that this has light natural coverage using a foundation brush. It tones down my redness with ease. It can be built up, especially if allowed to semi dry between applications. I really like that it has SPF (PA++++) 50. I always use sunscreen, so adding this on top of my sunscreen base is just added protection. Also perfect for reapplication & touch ups through day.<br /><br />I also find that it is hydrating on my dry skin. Has a dewy finish. My natural skin comes through but looks better- more spruced up and put together looking. I do notice that the finish depends on what I use before hand. When I have used this on bare skin, it has a more mattifying appearance. When I use on top of my moisturizer and/or moisturizing sunscreen, then it has a more dewy radiant look. I prefer the latter.<br /><br />Seems to stay in place. I applied some to my forearm, and it is still in place a couple hours later. I have taken my finger to try to wipe it off, and it is still there.<br /><br />4 stars. I prefer it for light coverage. When it is built up, it seems to take on a grayish cast on me.",4
"I have used this before! I had used several GoMay products about a two years ago. I have liked them all, and there are some products that I have repurchased (love their aminos face wash). I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container. I am copying over my old review as the info is all the same, and my experience is the same. While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container. Has a press down lid that pops out some product. Keeps it clean and safe! BUT if you want to get into the container, the lid does come off.<br /><br />--Minimal scent- naturally occurring. Can't quite put my finger on the aroma. It dissipates quickly, and it is really faint. Like green tea and plain yogurt.<br /><br />--The cream absorbs quickly. It just soaks right into my skin. I have skin that leans dry, and I do follow up with either a hydrating sunscreen, or if used at night I add a thicker emollient.

"When the times comes to wash my face, this mascara comes off extra easy. I didnt realize how much other mascaras left behind, once I did my usual face wash (oil cleanse to start, then follow up with water based), and the mascara began to break down right away. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />This SkyHigh mascara is actually lengthening. I have basic lashes, and I dont expect anything magical from mascara. But this is noticeable on my lashes, and as I was swiping it on I could see the lashes looking elongated. Not clumpy (that's good or bad depending on the look you are going for). This has more natural look. I haven't noticed any flaking, definitely no smudging. My eyes are easily irritated by makeup, and this mascara doesnt seem to bother me. I can wear it on both upper and lower lashes.<br /><br />At a budget friendly price ($5 for 1, or $7 for pack of 2), it is worth trying. I would consider it again at this price. Another cheapie I really like is Essence, which has both waterproof and non waterproof options: https://www.amazon.com/essence-Princess-Effect-Mascara-Cruelty/dp/B00T0C9XRK",5
"An adorable shower cap that fits my large head. It says it fits up to 24"" head, and mine measures 23.5"". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn't a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.",5
"Primer, liquid Foundation, BB cushion, and a flat kabuki brush. I have another Phoera kit, and I like it a lot.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093GFPFP9<br /><br />I am not sure if Nude (#102) is the lightest shade they have or not, but if you are like me and have fair skin with cool undertones this may lean a little warm. It isn't bad, but if they had a better match available I would want to get that.<br />THEY DO!! this is for fair with pink undertones<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZ6QZLJ/<br /><br />The BB cushion is a tad lighter, and a better match for my skin. I do like both. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. I really like how these feel, and despite being a  little warm on my cool skin, the make up looks good on the skin. Doesn't settle into every nook and cranny, nor dry flakes.<br />My skin is 40+ so this is something I look for in make up.<br /><br />The primer is fantastic. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Use less than you think you need lest you want a more oily look to seep through. I find that primers like this are great for dry skin, and for more dry feeling foundations.. but their foundations arent drying. So less is more with their primer.<br /><br />The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. Staying power is good. Skin feels comfortable. Skin looks healthy. I can touch my skin after and it doesn't feel like there is make up on. Provides really good coverage with a little bit yet doesn't look cakey and fake. Can be built up. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. All my redness disappears (from Type 1 Rosacea). To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application- use a damp sponge to put it on, or use a damp sponge as last step to blend it in and lighten it up.<br /><br />I really think it is worth the try. I wasn't even going to try this, but since they provided so much information in their product description it really piqued my interest. If you need coverage with a natural look.. try this!",5
"Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word ""matte"" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all. I find that it nearly matches a bold lip tint that I like by ""I'm Meme""<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091GSRN78/",4
"Smells SO Good!!!  I'll add in some pics as the product pictures shown here dont do this justice. The contents are in a sturdy flip top box makes it look like a gift (and was shipped in a regular box, maintaining integrity of the product box). Almost reminds me of a subscription box as the deign on the outside gives it a special look. It kinda threw me off because I nearly expected more of a generic look. I thought, ooh did someone send me something? lol. But no, I ordered this lol<br /> Once I opened the box, a colorful, glossy card stock card with the phrase, ""Happy Birthday to You"" on one side, and totally blank on the other. This sits on top of dense, well packed brown paper grass. Each product is carefully nestled underneath. The products look good and they smell good. Really good-- not cloying and cheap. Just pleasant. The entire unboxing experience was pleasant, and I would totally buy this for someone. You know how some gift compilations look cheap? This has a classy, artsy look that I would be proud to give to someone.<br /><br />This will probably be my go to gift item for anyone who enjoys these sorts of products. Set comes with lip balm, a bath bomb, a scrub, a cream, a bar of soap, and a soy candle. I'll use everything. Personally, I use bath bombs in my shower as I dont take baths, or I use as a foot soak.",5
"What doesn't work for my hair, works for my cats. That is our agreement. So these are pretty much a pack of cat toys as I prefer hair bands that fit comfortably on my wrist. These have plenty of stretch, but elastic is tight when retracted. Good or bad depending on needs. So too tight for me to keep on wrist. These are ok if I keep them tucked into a drawer and I grab one as I need one. They have good snug elasticity for thinner hair. My hair is thick, but I can use them for the ends of my hair when I put my hair in a braid. I dont like them for pulling all my hair back. These won't be a repurchase. They're ""ok""",3
"This is a package of 15 individually packaged biodegradable wipes. All of their products come in 15, 30, or 45. This 15 pack at $8.95 makes them $0.59 each. Easy to open, all tucked into a flip top box<br /><br /> Excellent for on the go, for travel, for whenever. I have used a variety of Busy Co wipes, and I have liked them all, some more than others. When I selected this, I chose it after taking a look at the ingredients (how I always select items to buy or to try). So it was weird not to see direct ingredient list on this product page. I have included the ingredients here:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Hyaluronate, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Powder, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice<br /><br />This unscented GLOW formula is aimed toward those seeking to BRIGHTEN SKIN, IMPROVE DRY SKIN, and REPAIR DAMAGED SKIN.<br />Not sure who is trying to use this on babies, but this product is not marketed for that use.<br /><br />I use this on my hands and feet, prior to bed. Then I add my lotions. The wipe does a good job cleaning my skin and nails. Adds little hydration. Could use them being a little more damp, but they do work. I have a couple tucked into my purse in case I just need a wipe, but for the most part I am keeping these for night time use. While I think this product is ok, it isnt a must have for me, and I likely wont repurchase. But I do like other Busy Co products, and have found that they are a better fit for my needs (and have been repurchases).",4
"Nice feeling moisture boost. Lightweight, nothing oily about it to me. My dry skin loves a good hydrating toner, and this fits that need. I pat some on all over face, neck and chest. Sometimes I do this a few times to saturate my skin. Then I follow up with other products (serum, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen). Ceramides help build and maintain a healthy skin barrier. Hyaluronic acid attracts moisture (but be sure to lock it in with a moisturizer or an occlusive ingredient). Sedum provides intense hydration & minerals, and vitamins to the skin. So lots of good stuff going on with this toner.",5
"So calming, nourishing, moisturizing, revitalizing. $35? Great price point. What a treat! I recommend! Love it!<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry but clear skin (no acne). Minimal lines. Overall healthy save for redness & visible veins from Type 1 Rosacea (no bumps, no acne, just redness).<br /><br />Reminds me of some of the thick, luscious, rich leave on night ""masks"" that I use. Really nice used alone, or paired with their real ampoule drops, or with your own routine. Just slather on, allow some time to absorb before hitting the pillow. Wake with supple, soft, dewy, nourished, revitalized skin. I'm impressed.<br /><br />I haven't had skin procedures, but this seems like a go-to item if I were to ever have something done- whether it be professional dermabrasion, laser, basically anything that leaves skin a little raw and exposed for a few days and would benefit from a more healing like cream.<br /><br />the drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP",5
"I really like this OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion. I'm going with 5 (4.5 if I could, but leans more 5 than 4) even at early impression. Sometimes you just know.  I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion). No matter, I am pleased with my experience with Organa Cell products so far. SO much so that I have been looking into other products. I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there. I went to their website (Korean, so you will need a web translator) and they do not have the full ingredient  list shown (unless I missed it). Pretty much what you see on this product page is what you will see on their actual web page. I sniffed around other merchant pages (jolse,wantitall,koreanbeautybox, etc). but just found the same info.<br /><br />Real Ampoule Drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry, CLEAR (no acne), smooth, but contend with Type 1 Rosacea (redness, visible veins, no bumps). ALL that I have tried by Organa Cell has been gentle, no discernable scent, absorbs well, and feels good on the skin. Great for sensitive skin as it has components to help protect, build, maintain skin barrier.<br /><br />I dont rate based on price, we all have our own budgets. Organa Cell is pricier than most K-beauty I try, but it is still a brand I would recommend. I would like to see a full ingredient list, but I also find that it doesn't stop me from using their products and considering other purchases. Take my money, haha<br /><br />If I experience anything else worth sharing, I will be back to do so.",5
"Supremely soft. Seriously, the first thing you will notice is how incredibly soft these are. Really good quality, and attractive. I immediately recommend them, haha. Has a good stretch, fits my large head without feeling irritating (kinda forget it is on), and it stays in place. What is this sorcery?<br /><br />If I experience anything else while wearing these, I will come back to update. My initial and immediate impression was just so favorable that I had to jump on a review to say so.<br /><br />Currently $3.99 for a set of two. Good deal",5
"It works! Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn't take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for ""light hair"". It is a pale yellow powder. ""This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this ‘poo is for you"". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it. So far the product comes out from the nozzle well.<br /><br />DARK HAIR option: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084JCXT18<br /><br />PS.  dry shampoo can often be used as a body powder too. Look for formulas like this- just some clay and other body friendly ingredients.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Zea Mays (Corn Starch), Organic Maranta Arundinacea (Arrowroot) Powder, Yellow (Kaolin & Illite) Clay , Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Organic Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Powder, Organic Lavandula Hybrida (Lavander) Oil<br /><br />How to Use Organic Dry Shampoo<br /><br />1. Give your shampoo bottle a good shake. 2. Part your hair into several segments. 3. Hold your shampoo bottle about six inches away from your head. Squeeze until you see fine powder particles falling onto your hair. 4. Using a makeup brush or your fingertips, massage your shampoo into your scalp. Brush as usual, or (for extra body), use your fingertips to massage the shampoo into your hairline.",5
"My skin is dry, totally clear (no acne) save for some redness & visible veins from Type 1 rosacea. This sunscreen feels quite gentle and does not seem to irritate my skin at all. It adds a light but effective level of hydration without feeling heavy. It is a chemical sunscreen, so zero white cast. It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up. I have also used it over other skin care (hydrating toner, serum, light moisturizer) and it worked well on top of all that too.<br /><br />Not sure yet if it will be repurchase. I do like Fascy Lab products, so it's a contender. Worth trying anyway<br />4.5 stars<br /><br />Active Ingredients:<br />DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE 2.0%<br />BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE 1.0%<br /><br />Inactive Ingredients:<br />WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE, METHYL METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, NIACINAMIDE, BEHENYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM CETYL PHOSPHATE, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, POLYISOBUTENE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER, SILICA, ADENOSINE, CAPRYLYL/CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, DISODIUM EDTA, SORBITAN OLEATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE",5
"This is a gommage!!! The most gentle of all the physical exfoliation out there. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I also highly recommend anything by Easydew. Good stuff!  Know that this is meant to clump! Not supposed to have lather or creaminess. I had looked at the ingredients and some of the description and I suspected a gommage. The directions on box say to use on wet face and that it will lather. It doesn't. There is some clumps, but not as much as if it were used on a dry face, which is what is expected from a gommage. We want glorious clumps! For best results use on a clean dry face, not a wet face. I have tried it both ways, definitely use on dry face. Works but not as good on wet face.<br /><br />So use a generous amount. Just pat it in all over. Let it sit a moment, then massage it in in gentle circular motion. As you do so, small clumps will form. This is a combination of product and grime and dead skin cells. Basically, a ""gommage"" is like an eraser on a pencil, and your skin is paper. The graphite marks are dirt and dead skin cells. The product once applied is like that eraser-- it is removing those ""marks"". What happens when you use an erase? You start to see balled up pieces of eraser mixed with the graphite/pencil marks. That is more or less what is happening here. Those balled up pieces are a mix of product, dirt, and cells. Rinse, and carry on with rest of your routine. It is a very gentle ""peel"". And quite effective. But less so when used on wet skin-- the ingredients just can't grab the gunk on face as well. I'm surprised there is such a discrepancy in instructions.<br /><br />Instructions on container:<br />""How to use:<br />Apply desired amount of peeling gel and work into a rich lather by wet hands.<br />Gently cleanse by massaging thoroughly over face in circles, avoiding eye contour.<br />Rinse off with lukewarm water.""<br /><br />But the pictures clearly show what is expected--balled up bits/clumps.<br /><br />SO, it it may be a matter of terminology/language. Easydew has some wonderful products, and this is a good product that I will use maybe 2x a week.

"I'm pleasantly surprised by this Almay Length & Lift mascara. My litmus test to a good mascara has been reduced to simply whether it irritates my eyes or not. As for lengthening, lifting, volumizing, etc is meaningless in comparison. This DOES NOT IRRITATE (!!) YAY!!! Also, the blackest black is wonderfully black; makes my brown eyes pop. My lashes are well coated, making them look thicker, and there is a lift that I greatly appreciate as my lashes otherwise angle downward. Length is notable too. My lashes are nomrally ho-hum. Not thick, not thin, not long, more on short side, and angle down. This mascara is pleasing me. I dont care for make up except for mascara, but I rarely find one worthwhile. THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE!<br /><br />I'm feeling so vain. I keep looking in the mirror at my new found eye lashes!! haha!!<br /><br />this product is hypoallergenic and ophthalmologist tested.<br /><br />PS. Pics are of mascara only. No other make up. I realized that this darkens my lash line enough to look like I'm wearing eyeliner. I'm not! :)",5
"Hopefully the bottle I received was an oversight in aging inventory. My bottle was hard to get open, and once I did I could immediately tell that the oil had oxidized. Totally unusable as it was truly rancid. The oil was thick, all cakds up around the topper, and the bulb dropper was rock hard. I was unable to squeeze it. I think the dropper had dry rotted, then that allowed air into the bottle, leading to a rancid product. It was evident not just based on looks, but also that super special aroma of a rancid oil. Too bad, as I love seed oils for use on body, face, and hair. This had to go directly into garbage. Not at all usable as something with anti-oxidants become PRO-oxidant when exposed to air. This is going to do exactly the opposite of what you want. Again, I give benefit of the doubt. I imagine it was a bad bottle and hopefully not at all what anyone should expect. Even so, I have to rate what I have.",1
"I've used fiber lash mascaras before- they usually have a pronounced effect, and is why I wanted to try this Kissio Derol mascara. The thing is, it doesn't do anything for me. I am perplexed. I applied the primer (comb brush with hairs/fibers), then followed up with the bushy brush mascara. And.. nothing. I can not see even a miniscule amount of added volume or length. Not even more than a basic mascara. Initially it had not bothered my sensitive eyes for the first few hours but then my eyes started getting itchy and irritated like they had something in them-- the fibers were falling off into my eyes! My eye where it was most bothered was red. I'm done with trying mascara unless it is a known brand.<br />Sad :(",1
"I've only just begun using this, so this is a first impression review. I am fairly familiar with the active ingredients and understand how they work (and that they do work, so I expect this to continue that). The new part is the pearl extract, which has both immediate effect and longer term use benefit. I can attest to the immediacy, and it will be with using this for greater amount of time to determine if it a repurchase or not. As I learn more, I will share more. Here is a break down of what is in it and what to expect:<br /><br />BLANCHET GLAM PEARL RADIANCE CAPSULE SERUM is a supremely light weight gel serum with hint of floral scent from lavender, geranium, rose, and sandalwood. Barely detectable.  A little goes a long way. This weightless serum adds a mild level of healthy sheen. Korean Beauty emphasizes healthy skin, hydrated skin, supple skin, dewy, glowing skin. It is never matte. So while you could cover this with your foundation or powder, KB is all about letting natural skin shine through. The gentle, mild barely there sheen provides more of a glass look than a shiny look. Subtle. As for the rest... The primary active ingredients are NIACINAMIDE (2%) and ADENOSINE (.04%).<br /><br />NIACINAMIDE is a skin care work horse. It provides a variety of benefit to all skin types, ages, and concerns. It is a water-soluble vitamin (B3) that works with the natural substances in your skin to help improve skin barrier, fix past damage, visibly minimize enlarged pores, tighten lax pores, improve uneven skin tone, soften fine lines and wrinkles, diminish dullness, and strengthen a weakened surface. As I hone in on ingredients that pack the greatest punch, niacinamide has stood out as a must have ingredient in my skin care routine. I especially like it for its ability to brighten pigmentation. It also is one of few ingredients that work well with other ingredients without concern for contraindication or nullification. Skin care can get tricky, and this ingredient is just so easy to work with- so go ahead and use it with retinol, peptides, acids, etc. Niacinamide simply helps skin be healthy and look healthy and radiant. As with most skin care, it can take several weeks to several months of consistent use to see changes. This serum will help over time, but other ingredients provide an instant radiant glow.<br /><br />ADENOSINE is a rising star in anti aging products. There are studies that demonstrate that adenosine is an effective ingredient for improving the appearance of wrinkles, in both the eye and mouth area. Interestingly, adenosine directly affects the production of type I and type III collagen in the skin by binding to A2A receptors in fibroblast cells. So if it can help boost (or at least maintain) collagen, and help collagen from breaking down (collagen is what keeps our skin plump. Compare your 45 year old face to your 18 year old face, if your face now looks ""thinner"" despite no losing weight, it is the decrease of collagen that has produced that look). Since adenosine has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen, applying it topically can help to prevent (and somewhat even reverse) wrinkles. *thumbs up*<br /><br />80% FERMENTED PEARL EXTRACT is rich in amino acids and trace minerals that are highly moisturizing, soothing, and brightening. I must say, this is something that is new to me. Before this product, I had no idea that there was a use for pearl extract. It is used in topical skin care products as well as for use internally. I really dont know much about any of this, but a cursory search led me to a few interesting bullet points:<br />-Increases skin's collagen production<br />-Helps repair skin's damaged cells<br />-Lightens skin's tone and improves blemishes<br />-Diminishes fine lines and wrinkles<br />-Controls oil and shine<br />-Reduces pores and promotes smoother skin<br />-It has soft hues which shift subtly from direct to side views<br /><br />PURPOSE<br />Skin Brightening<br />Anti wrinkle<br /><br />Uses<br />High-intensity brightening lotion with 80% of fermented pearl extract in capsule technology<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />ACTIVE:Niacinamide,Adenosine<br />INACTIVE: water, dipropylene,  Glycol,1,2-Hexanediol,Agar,Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,Synthetic Fluorphlogopite,Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891),Polyglyceryl-10Laurate,Polyglyceryl-10Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin,Hydrolyzed Pearl,Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil,Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Oil,Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil,Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil,Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil,Glycerin,Propanediol Hydroxyacetophenone,1,2-Hexanediol ,Centella Asiatica Extract,Butylene Glycol,Propanediol ,Portulaca Oleracea Extract,1,2-Hexanediol Centella Asiatica Extract,1,2-Hexanediol ,Panax Ginseng Leaf/Stem Extract Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract,1,2-Hexanediol , Hydrolyzed corn starch Beta vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract,Glycerin,Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glutathione,Plankton extract,Disodium EDTA,Tromethamine Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Xanthan Gum",4
"This review is for the foot wipes only. I was intrigued as I do foot masks once a month, and I am always otherwise giving my feet attention every night. Sometimes I take a wash cloth to them, so these wipes are rather convenient when I am sitting in bed ready to lotion up but didnt take a wash cloth to them yet. These are quicker, easier, and nicer feeling than a wet rag. These aren't all that wet but I managed to wipe down both feet effectively enough. 14 wipes, individually wrapped. Suggested that only one wipe per foot.. so seven uses from this box.<br /><br /> The individual packets are convenient but wasteful if not using them on the go. I dont know how much benefit they offer beyond a basic wipe down. Non irritating, non drying. Not loving them enough to be a repurchase.",3
"I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot- leaves my hair soft, manageable, and healthy looking. I added in this serum as I hoped to gain hair density or at least reduce loss (or reduce cycle frequency and/or duration). I dont have trouble growing my hair, I have trouble keeping it. So my hair is long, but much less dense than previous years. I transitioned from minoxidil to this. I wont do that again, as any gains I got from minoxidil were lost-- and I do contribute some of that to not using this as consistently as I did that. I'll explain what went into that below. This serum helped the condition of my hair and scalp, so I think it works well with minoxidil instead of in lieu of it. I likely wont continue with the serum for a few reasons.<br /><br />1. there was no instruction as to how to use this product. It is a dropper bottle, and I pretty much just used it like I did with minoxidil-- massaged whatever I pulled with dropper and distributed all over scalp, primarily at crown. Was this the correct way to do it? no idea. *<br /><br />2. It does say to apply to clean hair. Well, many of us do not wash our hair every single day. I have long curly hair that leans dry and there is no need to wash it daily. So I am either applying this to unwashed scalp daily or it only gets applied a few times a week.  Hence the lack of consistency. So right here it eliminates some would-be users if it has to be on a fresh washed scalp.<br /><br />3. the dropper is uncomfortable. I do not want to drop it from the dropper. I want to run it across the scalp so as to keep it from getting on my hair. The dropper is a little sharp feeling (at least my bottle that I received). I like the dropper style, and my thought is that if I were to buy this again, I would use a dropper from an old minoxidil bottle instead.<br /><br />4. How long should this bottle last? Since I had no idea how much I should use, I often wondered if I used too much or too little. Any new hair treatment needs to be given 4-6 months of consistent use to see results, if any. I know the shampoo and conditioner helped, and this serum has great ingredients that will help existing hair and scalp health.. but the inconsistency on my part from lack of instructions as well as expectation of using on fresh washed hair made it impossible to see if I could get benefit from it.<br /><br /> * ""It is best applied to damp hair after showering. We recommend visually splitting your scalp into 4 sections/quadrants. Depending on the amount of hair, use around 3-5 drops per quadrant. I like to drop into fingers and work into scalp. The remaining amount on your fingers you can work through your hair. It is perfectly fine to use the serum many times a day. That being said, it is important that the scalp/hair is clean"" (--I saw this written in the community question section of this page. Including this on box or in a leaflet would have been greatly helpful)<br /><br />The ingredients are of quality, the products work well together. I have since gone back to minoxidil, and once I have stopped the current shedding phase, I may buy another bottle to use as a support product. For that, I give it 4 stars.",4
"I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.<br /><br />My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br /><br />That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn't look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br /><br />I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).<br /><br />Overall, it isn't for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

"Three pack of individually boxed hard soap bars that smell wonderful and fresh. Quite an uplifting aroma. thyme, rosemary, sage, lemongrass..mmm. Natural chlorophyll and organic cloves create a deep green color. The soap has lather, soft clean feel. I use this as a hand soap, but it can be used all over anytime- very nice soap that inspired me to see what else they have to offer. Not knowing anything about Elsha, I learned that it is a USA company that was established in 1935 offering cologne products, and eventually perfume and soaps. These soaps are handmade in USA. Although the eagle on a flag shield screams, ""'merica!"", the product listing would do well to say this (their other listings do). The box that the soaps come in are gray with an Elsha sticker on it. No information as to what it is, what is in it, where it is is from, etc. If there was at least an insert of information I would feel better about buying this as a gift. The website had produced just enough information to make me feel better about trying this soap, otherwise I had no idea what was in it or where it originated.  That being said, it is a good soap and I would consider it again.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil*, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil*, aqua, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil*, sodium hydroxide, carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil*, chlorophyll, lavandula hybrid (lavandin) oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, cymbopogon schoenanthus (lemongrass) oil, pogostemon cablin (patchouli) oil, thymus vulgaris (thyme) oil, syzygium aromaticum (clove) bud*, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, eugenia caryophyllata (clove) bud oil",4
"EDIT: one stuck well enough in the reclining/laying position, the rest just fall off if I move a smidge. I will not get these again. I had used one and thought them exactly like all the others I have tried. I had no reason to believe that the rest would be different. Then next one I tried just wouldnt stay put. I tossed it out. Tried another.. same. Tried another. Tried another.. same same. So tossed out remaining 4.<br /><br />This is not the silicone masks that are just silicone and are worn overnight. It's a neck treatment, very similar to facial masks. It is a juicy serum saturated mask that gets applied to the neck. If you already use facial masks, then you know that you will be wanting to pretty much lay down  or recline back a little while the treatment is in place (20 minutes) lest it possibly move or fall off. Very similar to facial masks!<br /><br />The material is on the larger side, and actually covers quite a bit of neck skin.<br /><br />I use all sorts of skin care products, so I cant say for sure how effective the treatment ingredients are. I do use facial masks, and adding in a neck treatment is nice-- just adds to the home spa self care experience. I love facial masks, and I think if you enjoy personal care goodies like this, then you will enjoy this as well.<br /><br />Individually packed in a pleasant looking box, they could be given as a gift, or parted out and shared with others.",1
"I fell in love with Easydew products awhile back. I do tend to use and try all sorts of products, but I have a short list of products that I really like for me. Easydew is on that list. Easydew is also a brand I trust. I just sense that it is doing what it says it is going to do. Budget friendly too. They dont use frilly words and overinflated promises. They just seem straightforward with science backed ingredients. I like that a lot. I think all or most of their products include EGF (epidermal growth factors) which I am keen on for skin repair and health.<br />I haven't used an easydew product yet that I didnt like or love. This Repair Control Renewal lotion always feels so good on my skin. I love it for my simple skin days. It has so much going for it-- addresses a multitude of concerns- and is gentle. It is one of those lotions that just make the skin look and feel good immediately. If you have dry skin, their toner is pretty great too.<br /><br />My skin: 40 something, dry skin. Clear (no acne, minimal lines) but with type 1 Rosacea (redness & visible veins/telangiectasias).<br /><br />My typical routine:<br />morning: wash face, apply hydrating toner (sometimes use 7 skins method), serum, moisturizer, SPF (I ALWAYS use SPF, that is my #1 skin care product)<br />night: double cleanse (1st oil based wash, then water based wash), hydrating toner (often 7 skins method), serum/actives, moisturizer and/or moisturizing overnight ""mask"" or occlusive.",5
"Easydew is skin care that is functional, effective, and always seems to live up to the expectations. I happen to like EGF (epidemal growth factors), and if you don't then just don't purchase Easydew DW-EGF products. I recommend doing a quick search to learn more about ""EGF in skin care"". I've been a fan for awhile now, so I was stoked to try this face wash. I use other Easydew products with success.<br /><br />My 40 something dry skin benefits from the gentle, hydrating cleansing. It has some creamy lather, kinda foamy, feels nice to massage in, and rinses clean. Skin feels good. Not taut.<br /><br />Dont need much. First couple of times I squeezed out what I was used to using with some other cleansers. This is thick, and once you add in a little warm water it takes off with lather. If you end up not loving it for your face, it would make for a fabulous shaving cream and/or body wash. This tube will last a long while no matter what you use it for.<br /><br />I use a two step cleansing process most nights of the week. So that means starting off with an oil cleanser to help dissolve stubborn grime and products (primarily my SPF, but make up too), then using a gentle water based cleanser to actually wash away was was broken up and left behind. Some nights I can get away with just a water based cleanser. Mornings I use just water based cleansers. So really I can use this any time.",5
"Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.<br /><br />Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin. Not sure what I am feeling. Its odd.. but it doesnt impact overall look, feel, or performance.",5
"I dont love the color for me, but I like everything else enough that I am am considering trying another color. I like to keep my make up simple, so I often go for an eye shadow pencil; something I can swipe on in a single color and be done. I often go for very light colors, or even more into brown or purple. This ""chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl"" reminds more of a yellow tinged shimmery champagne rather than what I think of as pearl (white leaning pink). It is definitely not a white pink, too bad.  I may use it blended in with something, but it otherwise looks sallow on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones. I do however love the ease of use, how it does not irritate my eyes at all, and it just goes on so smoothly.",4
"Lovely gentle and effective balm to oil cleanser. I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF,  I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash. You'll have to try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Currently using this gentle, clean, vegan cleanser by To Do List as my second cleanse after Mizon:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDJR7S4<br /><br />I have a couple of double duty balm-to- oil cleansers that I like, and I would consider Mizon Cicaluronic  as a repurchase.",5
"I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.<br /><br />I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.<br /><br />One does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer, then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.<br /><br />Love their designs on the bottles.<br /><br />Water, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Guar Gum, Lemongrass Oil, Orange Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lemon Oil, Rosemary Extract, Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap, but none remains in the final product)",5
"I like it. I'll use nearly anything so long as it doesn't dry my skin out, and even better if it has healthy ingredients. This hits those marks, and at the new low price of $5, it is a pretty decent body wash (originally I have it written down at just under $20). Obviously this is a much more budget friendly price. I have a facial cleanser by Hylunia I really like, and this has a similar feel to it. I would use this on my face while in the shower with no problems. It is gentle and non irritating!<br />It isn't super sudsy, but it lathers plenty enough to feel like I am covering my body and cleansing it. I always follow up with a moisturizer, and I thought my skin actually felt extra soft the next day (I take my showers before bed). Smells good!",5
"This contains retinol, so plan on using sunscreen as well as retinol based products can make skin more sensitive to the sun. It is a dry oil, so it soaks right in and doesn't sit on the skin.

I use it on my face during the day, and I like it mostly for my neck and chest as I already have a dedicated retinol product I use on my face a few times a week at night.<br /><br />There are several skin loving ingredients in this product that I like, and my skin seems fine with this product.

"These small bars of soap smell really good and perform well in terms of cleansing and not leaving skin feeling stripped. I like that they are made in USA, handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small, but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically, it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.<br /><br />The bars are thin, but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now, and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.<br /><br />The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove, Cinnamon, Oregano, Peppermint, Parsley, Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.<br /><br />It has been an odd, but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far. I may consider them again when I run out. I really think they are worth the try.<br /><br />""CLEAN INGREDIENTS - Our formula just 8 simple ingredients.

"I have Rosacea, specifically type 1 where I experience redness from flushing and visible veins (telangiectasias). Otherwise clear skin. While topicals won't really help the veins, I can use products that help even out skin tone where it is pink from flushing. Some products can initially make my skin red, then it calms down (especially if new). This ISNTREE Cica Relief Ampoule Duo Set has not irritated my skin. In fact, it has helped to minimize aggravated skin.<br /><br />The serum is extremely light. I think the lightest weight product I have ever used. The bottles are small, and I feel like I am going through it quickly. I may be using too much, I dont know. I  do apply to neck and chest as well as face. I already use a product with EGF (epidermal growth factor), and I thought that maybe in serum form it would feel like a more concentrated dose. I have no idea how much Isntree uses, but this product feels like the emphasis is on the Centella Asiatica Extract. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I am just not sure yet what I think about the performance of this product for my skin.  The two small bottles would be better as 1 bottle.<br /><br />--super light weight<br />--absorbs instantly<br />--not tacky<br />--skin feels instantly smooth (I also use some on the back of my hands)<br />--I wouldn't use it alone as a moisturizer, especially if have dry skin (like me)<br />--gentle, doesn't aggravate my skin, but that very well could differ for everyone (esp those w/ damaged skin barrier)<br />--contains soothing centella asiatica extract<br />--contains EGF- worth doing some research to see the benefits and to discount myths.<br />--ingredients that can help build and maintain skin barrier. Especially important for those with skin conditions where they are exacerbated by a damaged skin barrier. Got super sensitive skin? work on repairing that skin barrier before anything else.<br />--NO added fragrance in ingredient list. No naturally occurring scent either. I cant detect any aroma.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, smooth and clear (except for visible veins), leans dry. I follow this up with a moisturizing SPF (their sunscreens are great) or a moisturizer if using at night.<br /><br />I dont think it is bad. I really just think it is ok. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For me it isn't quite a 4 star product, so I am going with the middle of the road rating of 3. Your experience will vary. I think it would be especially appealing to those who prefer a weightless non tacky Centella Asiatica product. While I have zero issues with this, I am not likely to repurchase it. I have preferred products, especially for EGFs. However, if I notice anything else-- good or bad, I will be sure to update. It can take at least 2 weeks for a product to show its effectiveness, and it can take that long for the skin to acclimate to a new product. I am a little early on writing this, but my skin is used to centella asiatica as well as EGFs, and with some Isntree products.",3
"My tin is dented.  It just arrived in a warehouse mailing bag. There was no protective tape, tamper sticker, or cover, or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products, and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.<br /><br />1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications? I guess price it out like a sheet mask. $3.75 per treatment if assuming 8 applications. More or less depending on how much you use.<br /><br />I hope the company considers adding a seal or tamper sticker.",2
"I have been pleased with medical grade Easydew products, and this is another. It is an extremely gentle creamy cleanser and exfoliator (through enzymes). Effectively cleans my skin. Sometimes I use it after an oil cleansing, sometimes by itself. My skin never feels taut or stripped. Nor does it ever feel coated. My skin always feel simply clean and fresh.<br />Has a light fragrance- similar to other Easydew products. It doesn't bother me- no headaches or nausea. The scent dissipates quickly enough. I have no issues with this.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, fair, semi sensitive, dry, Rosacea (redness/visible veins).<br /><br />Don't need much for it to do its job.

"The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body.  Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, ""These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown to have negative effects on the environment"".  I'm not a big fan of slathering my body with butane, propane, or isobutane, but I understand their use in this type of medium. So it's up to you to decide.<br /><br />This company does have non aerosol body wash available too..<br /><br />The resulting foamy wash comes out thick, it is creamy. Because it reminds me so much of a shaving cream, that it what I have been using it for. Then whatever is left over I use on rest of body. Is pleasant smelling enough to me but it isn't quite a pure aromatherapy experience for me. Clearly it uses a variety of essential oils- rosemary, orange, eucalyptus, peppermint, limonene. However, for whatever reason, it contains ""parfum (fragrance)"" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.  I am not in love.  The experience is underwhelming. I am much too quickly going through the container. Aromatherapy experience is a little off  as I pick up on something other than essential oils. Otherwise the cleansing action is fine. But.. I likely won't repurchase.<br /><br />I think if I really want a foam wash, I will just use another body wash or make my own wash and pour into a foaming soap dispenser.<br /><br />CRUELTY FREE  |  NO PARAFFIN, SILICONE OR MINERAL OILS  |  PLANT-BASED | PARABEN FREE  |  VEGAN<br /><br />Aqua (Water), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Butane, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Isopropyl Palmitate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Mentha Aquatica Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Geraniol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate, Parfum (Fragrance), Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sorbitol, Propylene Glycol, Glucose, Propane, Isobutane, Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide",3
"Good basic sheet mask that feels cooling and hydrating. Feels nice when my rosacea has made my face feel warm (I have visible veins/redness from rosacea; no other issues). Excellent for use in the bathtub, or for a mini nap, or simply to help relaxation. Might even be perfect post skin treatment sessions that may leave skin feeling irritated.<br /><br />Stocking stuffer!! I love how budget friendly this pack is. I love making little self-care packages to hand out, and while I will buy and use masks in the $5-35 range, I prefer the $1-3 masks for the token give away (think: facial mask, hand cream, lip balm, etc.. tiny cheap self care packages). I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to. The more basic masks tend to be good for nearly everyone, and the resulting feeling is at least a fresh, hydrated face. So these are a repurchase for that purpose, as well as for my own use on days I want to keep it simple.<br /><br />I love that it has lots of moisture. The serum can be patted in all over face, neck, chest, even elbows & hands after.<br /><br />For all that it is, I give it 5 stars for this level of facial mask.",5
"I don't really have any de-puffed areas. I do have a couple of odd spots around the corners of my lips that I am trying to figure out how to attend to. I have been successful with Easydew products, so I added this into the mix to see what more it can help me with.<br /><br />-I love the container. It has a cool, modern look. Applicator is precise.<br />-The texture is cool and gel like. It is clear.<br />-Very light scent<br />-Gentle feeling, non irritating on my dry, semi sensitive skin<br />-A little goes a long way, just use a little.. gently dab it on. Allow a minute to absorb before adding other products<br /> -Key ingredients, benefits:<br />Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) helps to repair skin, and Hyaluronic acid (HA) helps to attract and retain moisture.<br /><br />I am currently using a variety of Easydew products, some of which contain EGF. I love how my skin feels and looks. I have only recently added this in, and I don't expect a quick change. I am using it around lips, and am considering using it around eye area. Since this can be used near eyes, I may keep it only for that area. I have their serum and moisturizer with EGF & HA.  I would say from my experience with this line, is that this is more of a longer term use item. I see it says something about instant depuffing, but unless you have a real trouble spot, it may not be instantly noticeable. What I encourage is consistent use. Maybe add in their other fill up products or Repair Control EX, then use this for specific spots.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, clear, semi dry, semi sensitive, Rosacea (redness/visible veins).",4
"I have tried several Easydew products, and they have all been great for my skin. I always want to touch my skin in awe, and have to remind myself to keep hands away. I am pleased with this Easydew EX Repair Control Renewal Intensive Moisture; it has been good for my mid 40s, dry, clear, semi sensitive skin that has type 1 rosacea (redness, visible veins- ""telangiectasias"").<br /><br />It has ingredients to help repair skin, to build and maintain skin barrier, to help brighten skin, to calm the skin, to hydrate the skin.  My skin is always well moisturized, feels dewy and supple, and never ever as a problem with being irritated.  I like how it feels when I first put it on, and I like how my skin looks and feels come morning after having put it on the night before.<br /><br />I like it for day time or night time use. It is surprisingly hydrating.  Works well under my sunscreens. Works well over other serums. While I prefer a heavier cream at night, this is instantly moisturizing enough that I don't need to add anything else on top. Perhaps once the extra dry cold weather comes in, then I will add something on top. However, when paired with their hydra toner, it may be enough no matter the humidity.<br /><br />It has a light fragrance (has fragrance as an added ingredient, for those who refrain). Not great but not bad. Fortunately it is light and doesn't linger.<br /><br />Any alcohols used in this are fatty acid alcohols and are highly beneficial to the skin, especially dry skin.<br /><br />Using medical grade EGF,  it contains 10ppm of EGF, which means that it contains the maximum amount of EGF allowed for a cosmetic product to give you maximum results.",5
"My skin: mid 40s, clear, dry, semi sensitive, Rosacea (redness, visible veins, non-acne).<br /><br />Great ingredients that are helpful in creating and maintaining a healthy skin barrier. Ceramides are vital in this role which this product contains. As well as other skin loving, skin calming, skin repairing ingredients such as resveratrol, St Johns Wort, Centella Asiatica, probiotics, and prebiotics, peptides, and niacinamide.<br /><br />Lightweight, slightly creamy, easy to absorb serum that works well on its own but doesn't seem to play well with foundation. Maybe I haven't found the right product yet to use on top. When I apply makeup, in no time the skin looks like it is peeling heavily, but it is just the product peeling off. Even when using a little. This is the worst I have ever experienced with any product. Again, it might be what I have tried it with. And by itself.. seems totally fine. Your experience may vary.<br /><br /> Use a light hand, as it seems it doesn't take much to cover face, neck, chest. So, little goes a long way which is a good thing.<br /><br />Worthwhile to try.",4
"This Juicy Chemistry face & body scrub is a very mild, and seemingly gentle ""scrub"" chock full of great ingredients. For rating, I am right in the middle of neither really liking it nor really disliking it (ok, maybe leaning a more toward dislike for me). The ""3 stars"" include the fact the company (and their ingredient selections) seems of high quality and may be worthwhile to check out.<br /><br />I have mixed thoughts on this, so please bear with me as I try to explain.<br /><br />At first glance, the small container is packed to the brim with a dark brown, dry, granular looking substance. This is primarily a combo of coffee powder and cocoa powder. I thought it was going to be a rough scrub, and immediately thought that there is no way I would use that on my face. Since it says, ""for face AND body"" my plan changed  to use it on my body in the shower. However, the directions say to apply TO FACE, and allow to sit for 10 minutes/until dry. That isn't happening as a body scrub. In the shower.<br /><br />So now I am back to trying it on my face. It did not come with a spatula or spoon, so plan to use your own. Or scoop out with a finger.I have tried it by spooning out a bit of product and adding water, adding a hydrosol, and adding an oil. The latter makes it easiest to use through I do not know if it impeded the other ingredients. Also, it wouldn't dry with oil. But it did stay in place with oil.<br /><br />Any granular feeling quickly melted down, so I felt better about using it on my face. But still, not a fan of anything granular on face. Overall, I don't like it for my face- I only tried it once because that is all I could handle. . It felt like it left some powder behind. I felt compelled to rewash my face to get any remnants off. Meh.<br /><br />Body is fine (and is why I selected it for use). When used with all bases I mentioned, the result was a slightly oily feel. Not heavy, not greasy. Definitely a little bit of hydration/moisture. Ultimately not a fan of it for my face, but do like it enough for use on body. HOWEVER, I do not ""keep it on until it dries"" while I am using it.. in the shower. I just use it like a regular body scrub. I either add water to it, or oil. OR use a basic creamy body wash as the vehicle. Now that I think of it, even a body lotion would work (especially if you have one you dont love and want to use up). Once again, the oil (or body wash/ lotion) is easier to worth- I can work it all over body, massage it in, and as it rinses away once again that slightly oily feel is left behind (not greasy, not heavy, rather soft and light; rather nice).  Make sure to rinse shower as this will splatter brown all over.<br /><br />I like that the product is packed into a small jar container, and that it needs a base (water, hydrosol, etc) which can be good or bad depending on your preference. By needing to add your own, the product is more concentrated (not paying for added water,etc), but it lends just a tiny bit of inconvenience. Use in the shower is awkward. Use as a scrub mask is going to come down to preference. If you like a more granular feeling physical scrub/exfoliator this may not be for you. If you use more, you may get more of a scrub feel (I guess you could add sugar). I use less as I do not want a harsh physical scrub. For the shower, I prefer a greater scrub feel, so I use more. I am thinking now I may add this to another jar, add some cream or oil, and some added sugar for an easier to use shower scrub experience.<br /><br />Packaging is nice, and pleasant to look at. Could be worthy as a gift if this seems like something someone would like.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List:<br />Sucrose*, Coffea Arabica Seed (Coffee)Powder*, Theobroma Cacao(Cocoa)Powder*, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter*, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Citrus Sinensis (Sweet Orange) Essential Oil*, Vanilla Planifolia (Vanilla) powder*, Simmondsia Chinensis(Jojoba Oil)*, Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Oil*, Coffee Infused Oil*, Tocopherol^, Helianthus annuus Seed Oil, Rosmarinus officinalis(Rose Mary Antioxidant) Leaf Extract.<br /><br />""Formulated especially for dry skin, this scrub brings together the classic combination of Coffee and Cocoa with a hint of Sweet Orange.<br /><br />Cocoa has powerful antioxidant properties that help to heal damaged skin and other skin ailments. It helps renew and promote healthy cell development. Ground coffee beans gently exfoliate the skin and also reduce the appearance of cellulite and stimulate skin cells.<br /><br />The fatty acids and Vitamin E content of Hazelnut oil help create a natural oil barrier that helps skin retain water and avoid drying out.

"Quick absorbing, non greasy watery hand & body lotion. I like my body lotions to be on the thin side as I find it easier/quicker to apply as well as quicker to absorb. When I have extra rough spots, then I don't mind using a thicker emollient. But for just out of the shower lotion to lock in moisture.. I want a thinner lotion. This provides that. Yet, it is moisturizing enough to use any other time of day. Leave at kitchen sink for hand moisturizing as needed is great too. But not at bathroom sink lest someone mistakes it for toothpaste, haha. It is in a toothpaste style container. Just flip cap and squeeze.<br /><br />It feels nice on skin, has no added fragrance. I like their 1513 face lotion and I like this hand/body lotion too. I tend to have dry skin, so I find both are better for me for summer or days I just a light hydration boost. Easy to use, no frills lotion that is gentle on skin. I appreciate the nourishing ingredients and that they offer a no fragrance added option. Any hint of scent is entirely naturally occurring. However, this may not be for you if you seek to avoid essential oils as is is listed at the end.<br /><br />Overall it is a nice product. No irritation.

Oilier skin tends to age better. I have dry skin, but I have been moisturizing and protecting with SPF since my teens).<br /><br />MY skin: Mid 40s, very clear, very fair, minimal/no lines, supple, leans dry, has Rosacea (non-acne, just flushing and redness from visible veins). My skin loves hydration, oils, thicker heavier products.<br /><br />This product:<br />--stay fresh, pump style tube container (think of a toothpaste container with a pump)<br />-- thin, light, but rich lotion.<br />--smooth, glides on<br />--absorbs quickly, no lingering sheen or greasiness.<br />--plays well with other products (ie; toners, serums, SPF, make up)<br />--gentle, non irritating.<br />--skin nourishing ingredients<br />--no added fragrance; barely there naturally occurring scent.<br /><br />When I use it: daytime after serum (if I use one) but before SPF.<br /><br />Quite a range of experiences and preferences, but that make sense since we all have different skin and skin care needs. So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn't seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don't feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn't feel like it is drying, it doesn't give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier. Maybe over time? I am thinking this might be good for dehydrated oily skin, or normal to lightly dry skin. I am just guessing.<br /><br />I would use it to hold in other hydrating products like a thin mask. Or MAYBE on days when I just want something on and I don't want to fuss.<br /><br />Unexpectedly great for hands. Immediate softness. The backs of my hands feel super wonderful after applying this. The pump container makes it easy to dole out on the go. Would be great for keeping in a purse.<br /><br />Since it is thin but rich as well as the ease of application makes it REALLY nice as a neck and chest cream. If this formula is supposed to increase skin oil over time, then having that added advantage applied to the neck (naturally not oil area) could be a game changer for those concerned with skin on the neck.<br /><br />I think it is lovely, overall. 4 stars",4
"Individually wrapped cleansing cloths that are way better than any other I have used in the past. The material has a good strong feel, and it is large enough that it nearly feels like a washcloth. I can really get my hand on it. The packets easily tear open. The cloth, once wet becomes crazy sudsy. It has a barely there scent. I really have to sniff to be able to detect anything. Very fresh.  The lather is gentle and non drying. I was surprised that my face was not feeling parched or taut afterward.<br /><br />Not only for face, but it makes for a decent cleansing cloth to have a ""bird bath"" at the sink. Just wipe down everywhere you need to, rinse the cloth, rinse your body, rinse the cloth again, ring it out, use it to pat down the body.. and away you go.<br /><br />I think one could get away with using half a cloth easily for just face washing as there is plenty of cleaning agent in it.<br /><br />Overall it is a lovely product. I think it is perfectly packaged for occasional use, or for on the go/ travel. If I were to use it all the time, I would prefer something with less packaging. Maybe they have that... I didn't look.<br /><br />But for travel: definite yes. I would go so far as to use one in the shower to take care of face and entire body. The cleanser is so gentle, which is a huge draw for me and my dry/rosacea skin.",5
"My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive*, clear but with redness/visible veins (rosacea).<br /><br />My skin has been really loving this Easydew Daily Double Hydra moisturizer. I love K-beauty products and hadn't heard of this line. I am glad to have been able to try it as it just works really well for me. I highly recommend that it is paired with their Double Hydra Toner, especially if you like using hydrating toners using the 7 skins method (apply toner in layers until skin has soaked up as much as it can). Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference. Seems to play well with other products (SPF, serums, masks)<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077BTR9H4/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_dp<br /><br />As someone who engages in hobby skin care, I like finding through trial and error items that I would buy again, or would be my go-to if I had to choose just a couple things. These two are my go-to items. If I don't feel like playing around with other products, or if I am in between testing products, this combo just saves my skin and makes it look and feel so good. In a time when we really shouldn't be touching our faces (and we shouldn't anyway), sometimes I can't help it as my skin just feels soft and pleasantly moist.<br /><br />The bottle style is very familiar to me. Tall, thin, with twist off cap. Squeeze to get product. 2.02 fl ounces will last quite some time even when using a generous amount. Dont forget neck and chest :)<br /><br />When I say I have semi sensitive, I used to have really sensitive skin- felt easily irritated, often had a burning feeling or itchy feeling. I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff. Definitely recommend.",5
"Interesting array of ingredients. The predominant scent (and minor, initial flavor) is that of seaweed, since that it the primary ingredient.

I used to have incredibly crazy thick hair and over the past 10 years or so, it has greatly reduced. My hair grows fine (it is nearly waist length) but the hairs are thinner, and the overall volume on my scalp has reduced. While we all naturally shed, the amount that comes out when I am in a shedding cycle is depressing. I hope to reduce the frequency and amount of loss. SO, I am taking supplements, starting some new DHT blocking shampoo and conditioner, adding in a scalp treatment.. etc. This supplement is all together different than what I have been taking, so I am extra hopeful for its effectiveness. It am currently either in an ""off shedding cycle"", or my approach is working. I don't want to claim yet that this is working as I think the benchmark for noted improvement is 3 weeks.

This makes the first benchmark accurate. ""After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling"". Possible that I was ending a shedding phase, but I have indeed experienced reduced shedding while taking this product.<br /><br />It is because of this that I decided to KEEP GOING with it. Going forward.. For me to be able to tell the second benchmark has been met, ""After 3 months.. almost 40% of new/regrowth.. will be seen"" I will need to continue to buy this.  So I know I will actually need at least 2 more to be able to tell if this second benchmark is accurate. I may be awhile, but I will continue to update. (and of course, if it does actually work, then I will be continuing this for quite some time).",4
"The ""Drop the Bomb"" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: ""Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine""! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won't even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn't grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my ""reapply"" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn't even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn't really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far. If I experience anything else, I will be back to say so.<br /><br />For all the other ingredients, the each rate 1-2 (very low in terms of hazard to self or environment) on EWG Skin Deep Database.",5
"First one I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. When I looked at it, I thought I had been bamboozled as it appears to just be an airy dry foam sponge in a tin can. Maybe that is all it is. So I set out to change eye shadow colors, and was floored by how it thoroughly cleaned my brush. What is this sorcery? I don't use too many colors, and I either change brushes or wipe it on a reusable cotton round to clean off one shadow before moving onto next. My brushes always still have a little color on them (whether it be powder or cream). THIS? This took it all off my brush.<br /><br />I still stare at my clean brush in wonderment.<br /><br />Are there better eye shadow switching pans? no idea. I can only tell you that my brushes always come clean, so far.<br /><br />Also, fits nicely in my make up box!",5
"I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, ""made for USA but made in China"", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive ""natural, healthy"" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes ""4D silk fiber lashes"", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.",4
"Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.",4
"Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, ""medium"" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.",5
"I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted ""sheet mask"". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.<br /><br />--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA™ removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth. Softly cleanses skin, non irritating.<br /><br />--Skin soothing: TECA™ formula (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) delivers a soothing benefit to skin; helps create bright skin. Centella Asiatica has potent antioxidant properties, rich source of amino acids, and there's additional research showing that it's a good hydrating ingredient to soothe upset or compromised skin.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Charcoal Powder(310ppm), Peat Water, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Allantoin, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Propanediol, Citric Acid, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Alcohol, Rutin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium EDTA",5
"This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain ""parfum"" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn't cloying. So I don't know. I'm afraid it might trigger a headache for me. I may have to have someone else in the household finish it off. Love the other one I mentioned, though!<br /><br />As for how it works- no problem. A thick frosting like creamy texture with a hint of grit. It does a nice job cleaning, polishing, and leaving the skin feel smooth and moisturized. It is a gentle scrub- very gentle. Definitely softens skin. I scoop out a generous 1/8-1/4 cup amount to use on my body. With that amount, I expect several uses from this squat container. I particularly like this one for my legs and feet as they are the most neglected in terms of skin care.<br /><br />I really do like Natural Soultion salt scrubs, and it appears that there are 4 kinds. This one based solely on the fragrance is a miss for me, but another one happened to be a hit for me, which I will continue to use as needed.<br /><br />EDIT: While a whiff from the container is too strong for me, the actual aroma in the shower continues to be pretty tame. It dawned on me to smell my skin after showering (something I didn't do with prior showers prior to initial review), and my skin doesn't have that strong smell that I note from the container. It smells pleasant and light, and I wanted to come back to say so.SO I just wanted to say that I haven't had a headache, and I don't actually smell like the scent from the container- I was concerned I would have that perfume smell. It isn't there, thankfully.<br /><br />I'd boost it to a 5 rating, but the product descriptions says, ""No Artificial Fragrances Or Perfumes"", and ""parfum"" is on ingredient list- and doesn't say where that is derived from.",4
"These are great. I love the look- nice colors and design. Just the right size for travel, and are TSA approved sizes. Easy to use, easy to clean, good seals. I don't travel much but my husband does often for work- sometimes by plane often by car. Either way, he has to pack toiletries. With six squeeze bottles and 3 tubs, he has some and I have kept a few for my own use. The fact that they are BPA free food grade silicone opens up some options for use of these bottles- whether traveling or for out and about (work lunches!).",5
"WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2"". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5"". Many are 1"" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.",4
"So much better results than a manual toothbrush. So much better than a battery operated toothbrush. This really does a good job getting the teeth and gum area clean. Definitely helps in keeping mouth healthy. I have a used a few brands and they all do a good job- some last longer than others, some have replacement heads that can be purchased as generic, some dont. I usually purchased the name brand replacements. Anyway, I was always happy with my toothbrush.",5
"I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (""anti-fouling rubber stopper""). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We'll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.",4
"I waited a little while after trying out this product to write a review. I was super curious about it, and I was hoping that it was something amazing that I may have overlooked in my skin care routine. I read that it is way more effective than an eyebrow razor. Then I tried it, and it made me laugh. It is not better. I don't want to sound cynical, but I really don't want  you to spend money where you don't have to.  See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don't let this more expensive ""deplaning tools"" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, ""WAND"") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, ""deplaning"" in the description. Despite the product description/cautionary tale- eyebrow razors are sharp enough, as well as regular razors. Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don't fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it ""deplaning"") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn't just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn't great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What's in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, ""deplaning blade"") in each handle (ie; ""wand""). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don't expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The ""wands"" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the ""instructions for use"" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don't like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.",1
"It doesn't perfectly straighten the hair, but it definitely smooths it out, getting it pretty close to straight. The crush style straightener is pretty easy to use. It will take a little getting used to over using a flat plate straightener. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to use it on my long, thick, wavy hair.. but I had no trouble with it. My first time using it was on not freshly washed hair- maybe a day or two after last shampoo. I used a little thermal protector, and then started swiping the brush through my hair. It took longer than using a flat plate to get hair smoothed out, but I do like the natural looking results. I like the ability to use a fine water mist- this helps to smooth out the hair.",4
"Jade roller and jade scraper comes in pleasant looking box with a small bag to store these items in. It would make for a nice gift. Product claims to be made of real jade, which I looked for in making my decision.<br /><br />The jade roller feels good on the face, especially when first being used due to the coolness of the stone. I wouldn't normally buy something like this, but I already massage my face a little every day (fluid build up), so I thought this would be an interesting way to change things up.<br /><br />Again, I love the feel of the cool stone rolling across my face. I have rosacea and it just feels so comforting on my reddened skin. I haven't been real consistent with its use so I can not attest to how effective it is in terms of benefits to the skin. It does provide a gentle massage, which is good for draining lymph nodes and helping to reduce swelling. I am using it before I put on moisturizers, etc, as per recommendation on instructions. It says using this before hand will help the products work better. In my 40s with barely emerging fine lines, I am all for doing what I can to keep those at bay.<br /><br />As I learn anything new, I will add to my review.",4
Works easily and well.,5
Really cute wig that looks natural on. Loved it!,5
I do my facials at home to save money and I love this. It is so relaxing to use. I love how it glides over your face and gives you a mini massage. All in all I am really pleased and it is quite beautiful to boot!,5
I have a huge claw foot soaking tub and the back of it kills my neck. This was the perfect solution. Now I can lay in there and relax without my neck hurting. Love it! Shipping was fast!,5
110% recommend! Nothing curls my hair ever BUT bed head curlers! And it stays for days. The pics are from yesturday curls I didn't do anything but wake up and toss it in a pony tail. Do yourself a huge favor and get it!!!!,5
"I bought these for my 3 year old daughter who is moon obsessed. She’s picked them out from the multiple choices on amazon. We’re on day 7 and it’s still on, only worn off about 1/2 way. She loves them, and it makes her very happy. Would buy again!",5
I love the body wash! It has an amazing smell. The lotion does not smell quite as good but it's not bad. It is a light lotion.,4
I love the scent that leaves on my hair!! And my hair has never looked better! Will be buying more!! Thank you!!,5
I like the variety of colors it came with. They were not as tight as most head bands are which was great. So far they have held up well and have not come undone.,4
First time using a gel UV light and I am surprised at how easy it was to use. It comes with 4 different settings and definitely made things easier & quick way to get nails done.,5
It went on smoothly and was precise. I did have to re apply. It is similar to the NYX eye liner but applies better. But by the end of the day it was faded.,4
The nails did not stick to my daughter's nails.,3
I like to hear hair I just don't like the term dreadlocks because i do not dread my hair i love my hair i. Thank you. Brother Oran Z,5
[[VIDEOID:50c6456a14894703519e5e34115f6021]] I really like Willie Morrows products and this comb is excellent. I love to use this type of comb when I'm doing relaxers or Jerry curls. The loop is good for taking a section of the hair when it's in a base. The back of the Cove is good to smooth out the back of the head and the sides. I recommend this comb. I think you'd get a better deal when you buy the three black ones because when you buy this one you pay half the amount of the comb to ship which is not hip. Thank you for looking at my review and God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life. Baba Oran Z,5
"[[VIDEOID:7cfc995b010d23bc7176b91f843fecfa]] Hotep and party on brothers and sisters and thank you for looking at my review of the HMPRT 80s 90s Costume, A Black Mullet Rocker Wig and Wig Cap, Black T-Shirt, Wayne’s World Baseball Cap, and Inflatable Guitar. What I like about this set it's a spoof of Wayne's World and it comes with a Wayne's World cap, a wig, T shirt and an inflatable guitar. The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! “NOT” Long live, Queen.<br />“Wayne's World"" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled ""Wayne's Power Minute"" (1987) on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto's overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from ""Wayne's Power Minute""), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show ""live"" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first ""Wayne's World"" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season. The only thing I didn't like about the Cap is that it clearly looks like a woven Cap on the ad, but the Cap that I was sent is definitely a screen print which I guess is, OK?  ” NOT”.  I recommend my friend. Party on brothers and sisters and thank you for looking at my review. I hope it is helpful for you. If so, you can check the helpful box below, it will help me review some More. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  O DEE thank you",5

You can change the blades and will Bill. It comes with two extra blades to keep your dealing in spades. I recommend my friend shave it close now and then. Thank you. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ,5

"I hate the term dreadlock because I do not dread my hair. I love my hair, the term dreadlock was started by the British who dreaded seeing the Jamaicans the ones they call maroons, come down the hill when they were trying to go up the hill to get them. This is a beautiful set of decorations to go on your lovelocks and some of them really rock. I recommend my friend. Thank you. God bless you and may the rest of your life be the best of your life.

"With this kit you get more than just face paint painting cakes, you also get 3 professional brushes. I like the fact that each one of the cakes has three colors in it. The one drawback I find with this kit is that the three colors in each cake can sometimes affects you do not want, be careful not to get a color you do not want while trying to get one color out of the cakes that have three colors in it. Thank you, God bless, you and may the rest of your life be the best your life.  OZ",5
There is a difference between gel nails and Poly gel nails. This is a nice set of Poly gel nails. This is an excellent set for extensions.

Heart to heart from finish to start. These little dishes are quite small but that is what you need to do certain jobs.

"Perfect for those hard to get spots, and for those who hate flossing, like me. I don't know why, but I rather pick at my teeth with these tools than with floss. I'm flossphobic! LOL! These tools are super useful, and when it's time to replace them, I won't throw them out because they happen to be useful for sculpting miniature clay too. 5-Stars!",5
"I really needed this for my boys, I cut their hair and they always have hair all through their clothes and even though I tell them to shake there shirts right there when they stand up, there is always a trail of hair going down the hall to the bathroom.  This is so nice, the neck is stretchy and fits different sizes of necks, easy to clasp shut and open.  I only wish the back was longer like the front but I had no problem with keeping hair off them. It was really nice to only have to clean up in one small area.",4
"I watch a boy and take him to the park, his sunscreen always leaves white smears on and in my new black car, this sun lotion is clear so that won't happen anymore and it's 50 SPF so he is well protected. It smells great too. yum.",5

"love the wag, very comfortable, fun to go out in. My head doesn't get sweaty.",5
"I just want to keep touching it, it's so soft. I love the color, so fun to wear. My head didn't get too hot while wearing but I do have short hair that I don't have to pin up.",5
Took awhile to receive them but work like a charm,5
Worked amazing on ALL my brushes! All my brushes look like they did when they were brand new! Amazing product and would recommend to everyone!,5
"These Braided Hair Clips are nice. I used them in my own hair, and I did have a bit of difficulty in the beginning. I practiced on a mannequin’s hair and was able to use them easily.<br /><br />The pack comes with 4 hair clips. The clips have one big clip on the bottom and three smaller clips on the top. The small clips have little crystals in a flower shape. Each clip has different color combinations for the crystals. Each clip has a spring mechanism for the opening.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Braided Hair Clips to family and friends.",5
"This Argan-Infused Round Brush is nice. I used it while drying my hair and I was happy with the results. The bristles felt a little sharp since I have been using a different type of brush but not so sharp, that I couldn't use it.<br /><br />The box comes with a brush. This brush is round and has nylon bristles. The barrel of the brush is open allowing air from the blow dryer to pass through. Instructions are on the box.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Argan-Infused Round Brush to family and friends.",5
"This bag Makeup Sponge Beauty Blender is nice. I tried out a few of them and I am happy with them. I think my favorite is the little wedges. I find them helpful for getting around the eyes, nose, and mouth than with most makeup sponges.<br /><br />The bag comes filled with sponges. There are diamond-shaped sponges, wedge-shaped sponges, rectangle-shaped sponges, and round sponges. The thicker ones are pink, and the thinner ones are yellow. Instructions were not included in the bag.<br /><br />I will be recommending this bag of Makeup Sponge Beauty Blender to family and friends.",5
This Morovan Gel Nail Polish Remover is great. I used it to remove my Christmas gel nail polish. I was surprised at well it worked.<br /><br />The box comes with a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle of gel nail polish remover and a pump bottle. It also comes with a pack of cotton pads and a pack of nail clips. Also included is a file and cuticle pusher. Instructions are included.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Morovan Gel Nail Polish Remover to family and friends.,5
"This Acrylic Nail Brush Set would have been nice, but my fine liners are messed up. I have tried to fix them and so far, nothing works. Not impressed.<br /><br />The tube comes with 8 brushes in different sizes and brush types. These brushes are used to decorate the nail when the brushes are in good shape. There are no instructions included.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Acrylic Nail Brush Set to family and friends.",1
These Nail Art Brushes are pretty. I love the shape of the handle and the color. I like the 6mm size best.<br /><br />The box comes with 6 brushes. Each brush is a different size from 6mm to 11mm. There are no instructions for cleaning included.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Nail Art Brushes to family and friends.,5
"This RSTYLE UV Gel Nail Polish Set is beautiful. I love the red and will be wearing it very soon. The white I will be wearing but I will be using nail art paint with it.<br /><br />The box comes with 4 bottles of gel polish. Each bottle has the color of the polish on the top of the cap. There are instructions for how to apply the gel polish. It does not include a UV lamp, base coat, or top coat.<br /><br />I will be recommending this RSTYLE UV Gel Nail Polish Set to family and friends.",5
"This Janier Coffin Nail Tips Nail Glue Kit is nice. I love that I don't have to put on a base coat first. This nail glue is a base coat and glue on in one bottle. I also love the gemstones.<br /><br />This kit contains a box of soft gel tips. The box has sections inside dividing the different size nails. There is also a number on the tip of each nail. Also included in the kit is a pair of edge cutters, a file, a pack of gemstones, a small UV lamp with a USB cord, a bottle of top coat, and 2 bottles of glue.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Janier Coffin Nail Tips Nail Glue Kit to family and friends.",5
"This Makartt Nail Decoration Set is gorgeous. The only thing I don't like is the static in the containers. The pieces attach to the top of the container until you open them and then little pieces go everywhere.<br /><br />The kit comes with a plastic tray with 12 small containers inside. Each container opens and closes with a screw-top lid. Be sure to set the container in something before opening it as the contents will go everywhere, especially the small things. The containers have beads, gemstones, and charms. There are also 3 small sheets of stickers included with the kit.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Makartt Nail Decoration Set to family and friends.",4
This WALRUS OIL seems to work pretty well. I have two tattoos that were looking a little dry. I put some oil on them and they did brighten up some. I will continue to use this to see if it improves more over time.<br /><br />The pack comes with one 2 ounce tin of vegan oil. It does have a slight scent but it is not overpowering at all. This product is for new and old ink.<br /><br />I will be recommending this WALRUS OIL to family and friends.,5
This Simple Pleasures Kit is cute. I think I might have clicked on the wrong thing. This looks like a child's set.<br /><br />The kit includes two separate sets. One has a separator and 6 small bottles of polish. The other set has 4 larger bottles of the colors in the first set. This one has nail stickers included. These polishes are water-based and kid-friendly.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Simple Pleasures Kit to family and friends.,3
This Mini Nail Dust Collector is nice. I would have loved to have instructions included with the collector. I did go on the purchase page to see that I needed 2AA batteries. There is one part that I still don't know what it is for. I did a test and it did work and I am happy with that but instructions would have saved time.<br /><br />The box comes with the collector. It has two little tools include. On small brush and I don't know what the other thing is.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Mini Nail Dust Collector to family and friends.,3
These Crystal Glass Dappen Dishes are so cute. I got them for slip solution. I may also use one for polish remover.<br /><br />The bag comes with two cute dishes. Each dish is clear and just deep enough for slip solution or polish remover. The plastic bag reseals so the dishes could be stored if needed.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Crystal Glass Dappen Dishes to family and friends.,5
"This Havtyyise-3 set is nice. I really like the hand mitt. The holes on each side are better than the ones with no holes. This made it easier to get the soap on and keep the mitt on all at the same time.<br /><br />The set comes with a mitt, a handled back scrubber, and a pouf ball. The mitt is the best in the back and the back scrubber comes in second. I do not like the way the pouf ball is made and I don't see it lasting very long. It just flattens out because it is poorly made.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Havtyyise-3 set to family and friends but I will let everybody know about the pouf ball.",3
"This JODK Heatless Curling Rod Headband is so cute. I loved how it looked when my hair was in it. I waited 4 hours and my hair still wasn't dry so it didn't curl. I will be trying it again.<br /><br />The box comes with a hair curler and clips. It also comes with 4 scrunchies, 2 large and 2 small. There is also a beautiful, drawstring bag to store everything and instructions.<br /><br />I will be recommending this JODK Heatless Curling Rod Headband to family and friends because it is so cute.",4
"This Women Ultra Smooth Razor works well. It glides smoothly and cuts great. My problem is I don't see a place to buy replacement heads only razor blades. Instructions say to replace the blade every two months.<br /><br />The pack comes with a base, handle, and two razor heads. The razor heads have covers on them and they are magnetic. There are instructions but it does not say where you can buy replacement heads.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Women Ultra Smooth Razor to family and friends.",1
"These HH&LL 4pcs Large Hair Claw Clips work great. My hair is not thick but these clips stay in my hair. I am impressed at how well they work.<br /><br />The pack comes with 4 large clips. The teeth of the clips go inside each other enough to hold the hair. The colors in my box are white, pink, black, and brown.<br /><br />I will be recommending these HH&LL 4pcs Large Hair Claw Clips to family and friends.",5
This Silk Exfoliating Mitt is soft. I used the mitt on my face. I can not tell any difference between this mitt and any other mitts except that it is soft. No difference in the skin.<br /><br />The mitt fits the hand for cleaning. The resealable package comes with a mitt. It says 100% silk but I'm not sure I would agree with that.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Silk Exfoliating Mitt to family and friends.,1
This NULASTIN - Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser works great. I put it on my palms and then put it on my face in a circular motion. It felt great.<br /><br />The cleanser has a pleasant smell. It has an exfoliating cleanser and a moisturizer. It makes the face fill great.<br /><br />I will be recommending this NULASTIN - Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser to family and friends.,5
"This DARKLATER Tongue Scraper is not worth the time. I used both of the scrapers. I could not tell a difference after using them. I am not sure if I was doing it right but it did not come with instructions.<br /><br />The set comes with two scrapers in a metal container. Both of the scrapers are metal with a copper look. I did go to the Amazon website to see if there were instructions. What I found was a section for Videos. Under that was this: Help others learn more about this product by uploading a video! Then a button that says: ""Upload video"". I will not upload a video just to help others learn about the product when I don't even know about the product!<br /><br />I will NOT be recommending this DARKLATER Tongue Scraper to family and friends.",1
"This Pre-stretched Braiding Hair Purple is pretty. I got it to put in my mannequin's hair. I make handmade scarves, hats, and other things that would look great with this hair. I was surprised at the amount of hair I got.<br /><br />This hair is beautiful. There is 8 individually packaged purple hair. Included with the package is a latch hook but not beads to attach the hair.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Pre-stretched Braiding Hair Purple to family and friends.",5
This Jopuzia Natural Jade Roller is beautiful. The roller doesn't appear to do anything for my facial skin. I love the jade that is why I gave it a two-star rating not because it worked for the skin.<br /><br />This set comes with a large almost heart-shaped piece of jade. There is a roller with three pieces of jade. I will be using this jade in something else.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Jopuzia Natural Jade Roller to family and friends.,2
These Daletu Nail Tip Clips work great. I put on the nail and then clipped it to my finger. It helped the nail stay in place while it dried. I think they will be good for other crafty things too.<br /><br />The clips are clear and they are not too tight on the fingers. They come individually packaged. Because they are clear it helps to get the clip in the correct place on the nail.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Daletu Nail Tip Clips to family and friends.,5
"This HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss is bright red. I have fair skin so this ""gloss"" made me look like a corpse. It is also supposed to be a moisturizer but it made my lips crack and peel. Not happy with this at all.<br /><br />The lip ""gloss"" comes in a little tube and you brush on the color. If you have a different skin type than mine you might like it but it did chap my lips. I would think twice before getting this product.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss to family and friends.",1
Colors are beautiful!,5
"Beautiful, thank you!",5
"Loved that this came in a gift basket, very cute! These all smelled great and were a lot of fun to use in the bath!",5
"Works great and very easy to use! A great kit for people just starting out with nails. I also use it for various other things that I need to sand down a bit around the house, it works great on multiple things! Definitely recommend!",4
I used this when I had a cold and it was really relaxing and soothing. Helped my sinuses quite a bit. Definitely recommend this!,5
This cleanser works great. It starts off kind of like shaving gel and then like shaving gel you can form a foam by rubbing it on your face. Leaves my face feeling very clean but doesn't dry my skin out which is a bonus! Definitely recommend this stuff!,4
Great set that gives you smooth skin for your foundation makeup. Too heavily scented for my liking so I took a star off for that. This isn't the best primer I've tried in this price range but it works. A decent quality product that doesn't irritate my skin.,4
Beautiful! I'm so excited to wear it for my wedding.,5
"I hate greasy moisturizing creams that sit on the surface of my skin and clog up my pores, which, I'm afraid, is most of the moisturizers out there, but I do need something for my aging face in our dry, high altitude  home, especially in winter. This serum is easy to use and absorbs quickly. You apply it morning and evening with or without other creams. It won't make deep wrinkles disappear, but if you use it consistently, you will probably notice a positive difference in your skin, I know I have.",5
Christmas gift that was loved.,5
Great price for the quantity.  They work great!,5
"This bag is way smaller than I expected but still useful for small items such as tampons or toothpaste. Truthfully, I will probably just trash it or give it to my 8 year old after my vacation. I had originally rated 1 star but upped it to 3 because the seller was very attentive. My issue was addressed promptly.",3
"These are pretty colors but even with a base, filing all along nails and a top coat, they peel right off.",2
"First, these are so super cute and I loved them when I first got them. However, the love quickly faded as I started using them. While they totally work and hold your hair up, they break very easily and I have very fine thin hair. So, if they break so easily with my fine hair, then people with thicker hair, well good luck. These are better for looks than actually using them to hold your hair, and that's not what I was looking for. So, while these are super stinking cute, they don't really work holding your hair without breaking.",2
Cute nails but some of the sayings just don't go together and would have been better just plain.,3
These nails are super cute and wear beautifully. Love them.,5
Beautiful lashes and great magnetic eyeliner. The eyeliner is totally waterproof and lasts all day without problems. Doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes and these lashes are lightweight and totally beautiful. I have worn them a few different times and they still look beautiful. I am able to clean them gently in makeup remover and then let them dry and I can wear the lashes over and over again.,5
I love using this set when I am wanting to really go all out for my makeup. It makes everything last so much longer and looks so beautiful. It works great with my foundation and all of my makeup. It feels great on the skin and makes my skin so soft and smooth. It also does a great job hydrating my skin and getting it ready for makeup. Everything just works great together and love using it.,5
"These are very much for the more experienced eyelash wearer as they only have a tiny string to work with and not a strip. So I have to say that if you can't work with just string lashes then do not get these. However, if you don't mind then these are great. They look beautiful and blend in so well that people honestly can't tell they are false lashes.<br /><br />I honestly love them and they look very natural and beautiful. Would be happy to buy more later on.",5
"I'll admit that I do have a nail addiction and I do my nails all of the time. Honestly, it's much cheaper that way. Anyway, normally I don't fool with pushing my cuticles because I'm always loosing the wooden pushers and they always go so dull after using them for a while. Well, now I don't have to keep buying those because this cuticle pusher is awesome and made out of stainless steal. It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price. Couldn't recommend this enough to everyone.",5
"I am totally disappointed with this headband. One it is super cheap and easily bendable which means it will break easily. I have very fine hair so this headband is just horrible with my hair. It sticks up at the top and doesn't hold any hair back because my hair just slides out of it. Now, if someone has very thick hair then this would work perfect for them but for someone like me with very fine hair, this headband just isn't right for me.",3
"I have to say that I honestly didn't think this stuff would work or it wouldn't last as long, it would look strange, or that it would make me look plastic like. I didn't know what it would really do but I gave it a chance and tried this stuff. Holy cow does this stuff actually work and it looks awesome and natural. Key word, natural. I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff. Well, it looked wonderful. It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face. I couldn't believe how well Mistiq actually worked and how great it worked under my make up. This is one product that I completely recommend and suggest it be a staple in every woman's make up bag.",5
"I am very pleased with my experience using the Feminine Cleansing Wash. This is very easy to use in the shower as it has a hand pump. The scent is light and pleasant, yet doesn't leave a lingering perfumed odor. I have found that 'regular' soap does me no favors for cleaning my groin area as it's much to harsh for my lady bits. This is a great product to use for those of us that are mindful of our personal hygiene and want to be ready for any situation that comes up between showers. I find this to be a good value for the quality. I certainly will be making this wash a regular order in the future. I hope my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.",5
"I am happy with my order of the Resin Decorative Accessories Set. This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included. I hope that my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.",5
"I am very happy with my order of the Gershion Pastel Gel Nail Polish Set. These are great to use as it's a nice and even texture. The colors are great for me to use under different stamps, stencils and with stencils for nail art. They also look great as plain colors under a glossy or matte topcoat. I find that it dries easily under my 36 watt lamp. I find this set to be a good value. I hope you find my experience helpful as you kindly click the button below.",5
"I have been very happy with my order of the USB Nail File Machine. It works well and is easy to use with the USB cord. I often use this with a battery pack. The accessories have served well and after several months of use are still in good shape. It does great for my nails, but I also use this on my feet. It makes my self-mani and pedis quick and easy. The handle is easy to grip. Speed is quick, but not so much that it's difficult to control. I find that this is a good nail drill for personal use, but I wouldn't recommend it for multiple users as it does start to get warm in my hand when I am finishing on myself. I find it's a very fair value. I hope my experience is helpful and you kindly will click the button below.",5
"There are pros and cons to the Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack. I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.",4
"I have a lot of mixed feelings about the Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit. Primarily, the perm solution is really, really harsh. I cannot recommend the kit if this is the primary component of the kit you want. I would suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, the amount of glue rings, wands and microbrushes prove to be very useful to me. If you are after the accessories, then this is a fair value. I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand. Thanks for reading, if my experience is helpful to you, please click the button below.",3
"I'm happy with the Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick. It's packaged securely and all the pieces were in excellent condition upon arrival. I visit my dentist often, but I sometimes need a little help to find rogue bits of debris in some of my teeth. The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold. I find this set to be a good value and the versatile use is a great bonus for me.",5
"The anmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit gives you a little bit of everything for making your nails, or even crafting creations several different options for creative expression. My favorite part of the set is the half-pearls and pixie beads, but all of the pieces are really pretty. The tape works well with my own adhesive I already had on hand. This is a really fun set and I'd recommend them to anyone that likes to get creative with their nail art!",5
"The Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats. They apply easily, but I highly recommend doing a base coat first and a coat on top as well. There are also 2 generously filled jars of holographic butterflies that measure 4mm by 4mm at the widest points. This is a really pretty collection of butterflies and I couldn't recommend them more for both the value and variety!",5
Love this scent ... soft and long lasting when used with the lotion and perfume!!!!!,5
"Great product, Great hair remover, I loved it! It was so convenient to use. The only issue I’ve seen is the stickiness doesn’t go away easily it can only be gone by using the cleaning pads.",4
Bought this eyebrow trimmer during the pandemic time when all parlours closed. I Couldn’t believe how easy it is to use it and It is completely painless and trims hair with precision,4
Good,5
"This wig is very nice. It fit on okay. The quality seemed fine. It was a good deal. It looked somewhat realistic… obviously not like one of the $500 ones, but it is fine. It was comfortable to wear. It was easy to put on. It was cute. It was fun to wear for everyday use or for a costume. I would recommend it.",5
"This is a very cute set. It comes with a lot. There were many different colors.  The girls really enjoyed it a lot.  Everything seemed to be good quality. The packaging looked nice. They love Disney princess, which are very popular. The quality was fine with everything.  I would recommend this.",5
"I love butterflies. This was great for my nails. They were so sparkly. They looked so nice. They were a little tricky to put on, but with practice you will get better. They really were unique. The quality was good. You can give yourself a professional manicure at home for a fraction of the cost. I would recommend them.",5
These are great for parties. It has a lot of colors. It is very nice to give a cute look. They went on well. It wasn't too difficult to apply. They looked good. The kids really enjoyed them. They would be good for a party or Halloween. They were lots of fun. I would recommend them.,5

This was a very pretty hair comb. The rhinestones looked very nice. It really sparkled. It would be good for a wedding or for another event. It was nicely packaged. It fit in well in my hair.

"I had a Norelco years ago, then I went through three Brauns (the micro-foil ones that a straight instead of having three circular blades like this one).  All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!  I will never buy any other brand of razor again and I'll probably have this one for years to come...",5
"I use these to get myself extra clean after using the restroom. They work wonderfully, stay moist, and are decently priced.",5
"I got this for my daughter and she decided to give a letter to selected friends.  Unfortunately, we will need a few sets to be able to cover all of her good friends.<br /><br />I think this was a great idea.  Friends can attend at school events with the same hair pins to show their friendship or team unity.<br /><br />Good gift idea!",4
"This Acetone Free Nail Polish remover is great!  It works as well as acetone to remove nail polish and doesn't give off a headache-inducing smell when doing it.  In fact, there is a slight perfume smell to it.<br /><br />The only thing to note is that it leaves the hands oily after use, but that's not a big problem at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended because it is much less harsh than the traditional method and even more recommended for anyone who gets a headache from the fumes.",5
I got this for my son who is obsessed with my little pony.<br /><br />The tail is basically a hair clip with synthetic hair glued to it.<br /><br />The wig tends to shed a bit but that's normal for synthetic hair.<br /><br />The wig had inner straps to tighten it to different head sizes.<br /><br />Overall a decent little set for play time.,4
[[VIDEOID:bb5d02bd6cdc2aacb49b1a0f62af91fb]] My husband is a professional tattoo artist and he is always looking for the newest and best equipment.<br /><br />Tattoo machines are an important part of the tattoo process so having a machine that preforms well is a must have.<br /><br />The description says this machine is a 3.5 stroke but after using this my husband would have to say he believes it to be a 2.8 stroke in his professional opinion.<br /><br />When doing the tattoo he had to make several passes to get the line bold enough in the skin versus his other machines. He said this would be fine for doing black and grey tattoos but it is not a good machine to pack color.<br /><br />The machine is bulky and fits in the hand nice. There is no added weight and it doesn't feel uncomfortable in the hand.<br /><br />This is a rotary machine so traditional clip cords are not compatible with this.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent machine. Perfect for an apprentice.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount. My reviews are based on quality and performance and are never manipulated or altered in any way.,4
"Acne has been an issue for me since puberty. I am always searching for the newest and the best cleansers and treatments.<br /><br />I really love organic cleansers because they are very gentle on the face and don't load my pores down with nasty chemicals.<br /><br />This is a charcoal based wash and we all know charcoal is a purifier. This cleanser does not foam, however, you can feel it cleaning. It has a pleasant scent and is amazing at removing makeup. I have found a little bit will do it, you don't have to use a lot of cleanser to clean your face.<br /><br />I haven't seen any miracle results but I will tell you it does clean well.<br /><br />Overall a decent cleanser. Price wise a little steep but with Organics you're always going to pay more.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount.

"This had me at Rose Quartz! I'm a rock collector and I am all about beauty so this definitely peaked my interest!<br /><br />I've been using this for about a week and honestly I haven't seen an improvement in my complexion or anything fancy but this is awesome to use before applying makeup. It seems to grab the makeup and hold it on longer. Weird I know it isn't the intended use but it works! I also use it after I've done my make up to set it. If you compare ingredients to most setting spray that is all natural they are almost identical.<br /><br />The smell is light and flowery. Definitely has a scent of Rose with a bit of a witch hazel after scent.<br /><br />The spray itself is medium mist and covers the entire face with one burst. It's very light and absorbs quickly.<br /><br />This is a nice hydrating mist that has a multitude of uses and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount.

"[[VIDEOID:de92ae908edbae946014f9c8bd24b4e8]] My skin care and health is number one on my priorities. I am always on the lookout for the best products.<br /><br />This brush is definitely a must have. It has several attachments that keep your skin in is best shape.<br /><br />I tan in the summer mostly sunless but I also get a natural base tan. Before and after exfoliation is key to keeping a natural looking tan. In the video I am in a bathing suit (wanted to make that clear) and I am preparing to exfoliate before I go to the beach. With this brush you have a body brush, a facial brush, a pumice stone and a facial sponge.<br /><br />The body brush is great for legs and arms and even backs. The facial brush is Ye best way to deep clean all the makeup residue and grime from your face. The pumice stone is perfect for elbows, knees, ankles and fee. Lastly the sponge is an added bonus for serums and creams.<br /><br />My only complaint is the need for so many batteries. Other than that definitely a great brush set to have!<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount.

"[[VIDEOID:f7eef1e0d6ac999bf9c0518a71064d21]] This has two of my favorite things, blackberries and organic ingredients!<br /><br />I'm going to review each product in the set:<br /><br />Bubble bath: very thin like water. Produced little to no bubbles and what it did produce dissipated quickly. It does smell amazing.<br />3/5<br />Sugar scrub: Very moisturizing. Not to oily and not to dry. It has the right amount of oils. It left my skin silky smooth but my bathtub slippery.<br />4/5<br />Bath pillow: Very comfortable, had a bit of a strange smell at first I wiped it down with a cleansing wipe. The suction cups do come out but they are easy to reinsert.<br />4/5<br />Soap: Medium lathering it does clean well with no yucky residue.<br />4/5<br /><br />In all this is a decent set. I would like to see the bubble bath revamped. Then I could justify the price. As is I would not pay asking price as I could buy a better quality set for the same price.<br /><br />I was offered a discount to review this item. I paid 10$ out of pocket for this item. My reviews are based on quality and preformance and are never manipulated in any way.",4
I'm a bit of a hair product snob. Years of coloring has damaged my hair badly so I am very picky what I use on it.<br /><br />Not only is this shampoo organic and not loaded with sulfates and parabens but it has an amazing smell. Almost like a sweet cedar.<br /><br />The shampoo has a medium lather. I used 10 pumps as I have think and mid length hair. I also left the shampoo in my hair for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />After washing my hair was not greasy or heavy from residue. There was definitely a shine but no oily feel.<br /><br />I have oily roots and this shampoo cleaned my hair with easy while leaving it evenly moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased and I definitely will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item for free. My review and assessment is my own after personal use and has not been influenced or compensated.,5
Love this product,5
"While notes of sea spray and water blossom do evoke the beach, the odd inclusion of ""driftwood"" notes give it a scent that reminds me camp fires.  I don't consider this a feminine scent but it would make a nice men's cologne.<br />Maybe they were going for a unisex scent but for women the addition of notes like orange blossom or coconut might have made it more feminine.<br /><br />Disappointed.",3
These do not connect strongly enough for either the thick or fine hairs.  I am nothing but frustrated when I use it.,1
First off there is more than enough in this bag for a couple or three soaks. I got a lovely large chunk of rose quartz in my bag and it went for a soak in the tub with me. After a long day of farming duties this stuff really eased my aches. It is nice to have something that works that is already mixed up and I don't have to concoct it myself from all the various elements. Good lavender oil is expensive so this is well worth it.,5
The quality on the sewing at the zipper of these is why I deducted a star. The stitches are big and kind of loose. Repeated use may pull the zipper out. Otherwise the canvas is nice and I think I will do some fabric painting on these.,4
"These bands are great! I can never buy anything like this so I decided to check Amazon. Great colors, good fit, not too tight, not too lose. Nice wide band and a good look. Great value!",5
"My family loves this shampoo! I love the fact it has no sulfates! A lot of chemicals are absorbed through your skin so I feel good using this on my family! I have extremely fine,thin,and long hair and by the end of the day my hair is a mess! This shampoo has helped my hair to become flat! I am so glad I got to review this product for free or a discount,because I would have never found such an amazing shampoo! My daughter absolutely loves it!",5
"The key to having a tattoo that both lasts and looks great for the long term is how it’s cared for during the initial healing process - and this product is perfect to aide in the healing and aftercare.<br /><br />This moisturizing tattoo lotion is the perfect product to use after cleaning your tattoo. This lotion is excellent at hydrating the skin and holding the moisture without being overly greasy as many of other products tend to be.<br /><br />This lotion is far cheaper than many other similar products but I found the quality superb.  This lotion is much cheaper than what you’ll find at many tattoo studios but every bit as good.<br /><br />Having a vibrant, great looking tattoo requires properly caring for it through the healing process and after. This lotion is all you need to help your piece of art look great for a lifetime.<br /><br />You’ll never regret this purchase.",5
"The science behind facial skincare has made many discoveries over the last decade and in turn the best skincare products have evolved to take advantage of those findings.<br /><br />This Sunrise Serum by Merlot  is a perfect example of one of these products. Collagen is key to healthy, youthful looking skin - certain ingredients have been found to promote collagen production. This product incorporates the best ingredients known to increase collagen in facial tissue.<br /><br />In addition this Sunrise Serum has lightening agents that work together to smooth and even skin tone.  I was especially interested in this aspect as I have a few sunspots that I want to lighten.  Over the several weeks of using this twice a day I can see that it is gradually lightening them. Obviously, I understand any treatment such as this, requires extended daily use to achieve the results I’m seeking, but based on my initial findings I’m confident it will work.<br /><br />This is an excellent product that I absolutely recommend. I look forward to using more Merlot products in the future as I found this serum superb.",5
This product makes brushing my Goldendoodle so much easier.<br /><br />It arrived very quickly and is exactly as described.<br /><br />It is made to fit on the right hand and has a Velcro type wrist cuff that can be tightened so it doesn't slip around. The plastic tipped bristles cover the entire palm and thumb area making it so you brush large areas with every stroke.<br /><br />It is made from a breathable fabric which makes it comfortable and cool to wear.<br /><br />Hair pulls out of the bristles easily when finished brushing so it can be left clean for the next grooming.<br /><br />It is well made and should last a long time.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this purchase.,5
"It’s held together poorly, will not last long. So flimsy! Not worth the high price. This is a dollar store item at best.<br />Looks lovely though.",3
Does not work. Comes right off finger,1
These are simple and quick to use and make your feet look and feel good,5
"Put the Plum color on over hair previously colored Aquamarine and purple and I love the color. I literally only let this dye sit for five minutes and it came out so bright and even. Absolutely gorgeous color!<br /><br />Be warned it did slightly stain my sink and bathtub, but a good foaming bathroom cleaner, some elbow grease, and a bit of time made quick work of getting rid of it.<br /><br />The scent is very pleasant, and I also really enjoyed the ease of use and coverage of the dye.<br /><br />I highly recommend doing a small patch test to make sure it's a color that will look good on you.<br /><br />The dye came out exactly like the label on the package, absolutely beautiful.",5
"This did nothing to remove my color, but it left my hair feeling silky so it's worth 3 stars for that.",3
I followed the instructions carefully and did not get any magnetic effect. It is kind of pretty and the color does shift somewhat. Amazon refunded my purchase so I am still happy.,2
These tools are very useful for the ease of cleaning and sturdiness. Not a bad deal.,5
"I love these hair ties for my breakage prone hair. They are stretchy, soft, have no tight elastic in the middle of them, and the colors are super cute. They feel very well made.  Love!",5
I travel with these and they are pretty good. Not the ultimate in softness but they definitely don’t suck. They come in a thick travel bag that’s plastic and pretty fake feeling. Non on the bristles have fallen off and there is a good amount of brush sizes and shapes to choose from. *there is no spoolie with this set. ☹️,4
This is the lightest face roller I’ve used and held. It feels flimsy and like the metal holder will bend/pop out if you push the roller too hard on your face. The smaller roller is really nice to roll over eyes. Feels great! I wish everything felt weighted though. I think there are much better options out there.,3
"Small travel size of so-so conditioner. Smells great and feels like it rinses out completely but as for conditioning? It just sort of works. So, nothing too special but it doesn’t suck.",3
"Great product. Made in USA and right upon opening, smells fresh and clean. Like lemons and sunshine. The ziplock bag seals so you can store upright maintain freshness.",5
"I don't know if this is helping my hair regrowth but, I feel like it's helping my spider veins. It's easy to hold even for extended periods of time. It's not a rechargeable product. It must be plugged in while using. It is painless. I don't wear the super dark glasses. I just close my eyes. I use on underarm too. I will keep it up, I'm just sorta lazy.",4
"Wonderful lip balm. Creamy, not waxy and stayed put. Smells luscious and sweet. I feel like this hydrates for at least an hour too. No stinging upon application. The lids audibly ""clicks"" when closed so you know it shut. 45 spf too.",5
"This serum is so very very good! Smells warm and woodsy in a way, not floral or soapy. Very viscous, medium-heavy. The dropper only dispenses about 4 drops, which is enough for face and neck. I use a roller after applying too, which I highly recommend. I'm happy with the glow and hydration my skin has. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks.",5
My 14 yo is using this set and she loves it. The mascara is a deep black and it doesn't flake off. She also has had no problems removing this product with just a wet makeup wipe.  The curler has rubber grips at the end so it is easy for her to hold and use. Very happy with this.,5
"This masks works great! My hair is blonde and fine and tends to go brassy if not processed correctly. Using this mask is an easy way to freshen and brighten. Not too thick, almost whipped in texture. Totally moisturizes and rinses out without heavy residue.",5
"Very decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight, no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack!",5
"This is such a high end product. The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars.",5
"I love oil based cleansers and don't use anything else. But they are not for everyone. My 20 year old daughter doesn't like this product, while I think it's one of the best I've used. The smell is subtle and I love the suppleness of my skin after cleaning!",5
"Of all the extensions I've ordered, this is my least favorite. The blonde has so much brass in it! It's almost red in color. (I put a few pictures with my review. The lighter blonde is the color that I expect when I order blonde.) There are also more dark black strands coursing thru these pieces than any other brand I've used. Maybe it's just this particular color?  Comes with clips, which is nice. And hair is soft.",3
"I only received 1 tube of eyelash serum. I apply it right at my lash line, as directed, on a clean face. Have not seen any notable  difference. Does not sting or irritate my eyes.",3
"This stuff is wonderful. It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit.  The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized.",5
"There's not a lot of salt in here to make it exfoliate very well. That said, it moisturizes and hydrates beautifully. Everything dissolves and washes off completely and it smells so light and fresh!",3
Great for trimming our puppies fur.,5
"There are no instructions on how to care for the hair extensions nor are there instructions on how to securely put on the halo filament wire (actually a strong, clear plastic line that has 5 adjustable positions AND you get extra wire and snap-in-place comb fasteners).<br /><br />I had to search YouTube for directions on how to place it securely. I'm still working on getting it the correct size for my head size. I have very thin hair which might be the problem.<br /><br />There are tons of videos about different hairstyles with halo hair extensions. Plus lots of different updos because YES you can have an updo -- buns, pony tails, braiding etc, -- with these extensions.<br /><br />Much easier to brush/comb you hair with the halo than with taped extensions. It is NOT itchy like most wigs I've invested in.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!",4
"I love this stuff, especially for the price. I was looking for a benetint dupe. This has 3x the color payoff for a fraction of the price. I haven’t noticed much plumping action, but the color is so pretty that it doesn’t matter much to me. It smells great and I think it would look good on most skin types so long as you are comfortable with bright reds. My only complaint is that it doesn’t fade evenly but I mean, what lip product does?",5
"I learned awhile back that Lemon Balm is excellent for stress, which I have plenty of due to health issues. I make two quarts every night for the next day and it really helps me be calm and not worry. Highly recommend!",5
"We got the burgundy colored one for my wife to complete a costume we were putting together. It's an excellent color, a deep red but not too red that it screams cheap artificial. No, it won't pass as real hair, at this price point I wasn't expecting it to. But I must admit that I'm impressed at the quality for the price. My wife was able to wear it all day and didn't find it uncomfortable at all, and we both loved how she looks in it. Very pleased!",5
"It's nice looking, easy to use but I could still smell garlic and onion a but. It did lessen the smell it seemed.",3
This skin is so perfect. It is so easy to tattoo on.,5
Muy lindas pero un poco pequeñas,5
I’ve been using this brand of mascara for several months without a problem. I received this tube and on the 3rd time using it the stopper at the mouth of the tube that scrapes off some of the mascara fell into the tube. You can’t get it out. So now when you take the brush out of the tube there’s gobs of mascara on the brush. You have to wipe it off of the brush with a tissue or it can’t be applied.  Now I’m wiping it off the brush and throwing it out. What a waste!,4
Really cute headbands. Makes hair look really cute on a bad hair day.,5
I have naturally curly hair and don't like to straighten my hair very often since it is so time consuming.  This brush only takes a few minutes and then my hair is straight.  My ten year old daughter with curly hair also used it and she finds it very easy to use.  Price was great also.  Hair lazy and frugal mom approved.,5
Pretty but doesn't last for more than two days. It starts chipping or peeling off.,3
"My daughter always wants to wear perfume, but her skin is so sensitive. When I saw this, I had to get it. It is hypoallergenic, so it even works well with sensitive skin. The smell is sweet lavender, and smells amazing! It is perfect to apply after bath time.",5
"These big hair claw clips are amazing! My wife has thick hair and other hair clips are just not large or strong enough to hold all of her hair. These however are large enough and strong enough to hold all of her hair back.<br /><br />You get a nice variety of 12 different colors and they come in a pretty purple box. They work great for clipping back all of the hair, or in small sections as well when straightening.",5
"This 4 pack of travel lotions by Spanature is super nice, from the presentation of the product, to the performance of the product. They come packaged soooo nicely in 4 little gift boxes, so they are perfect for gift giving. Also, the tubes are the perfect size to fit in your purse- so they are great for on the go or even traveling!<br /><br />The lotion itself is very moisturizing, and not greasy at all. The green tea scent is not strong at all, which is perfect if you are sensitive to strong scents.",5
"This mannequin head is great for the price. It includes the clamp, and the hair is very thick. The hair is not real human hair, it’s synthetic... so it doesn’t curl very good like real human hair.<br /><br />It is great for trying out new hair styles though, even for practicing hair cutting. It comes with 2 clips and rubber bands as well.",5
"My wife has always wanted to try magnetic eyelashes, so she decided to give these a shot. They really do work! But, with these practice makes perfect.<br /><br />They come with 2 tubes of magnetic eyeliner (black), and 10 sets of eyelashes along with the application tool. When you apply the magnetic eyeliner, you have to be precise. The eyeliner is black, and will look very dark if you do too thick of a line. I would do thinner lines if possible, with about 2 layers so that the eyeliner is not overwhelming. Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink. But yes, these really work! With more practice my wife will get better at this.<br /><br />The only thing is that the magnetic eyeliner does not come off easily. You will need a good eye makeup remover to get this off as it’s waterproof!",4
"These bath bombs are great, especially for the price. You get 18 bath bombs in the box. The box looks like a gift box, so these would make a great gift for someone special! ❤️<br /><br />The bath bombs are scented with essential oils and are very moisturizing. Each bath bomb is wrapped in tissue paper and labeled. The packaging is just amazing!<br /><br />The scents are strong, so these may not work for you if you are sensitive to strong scents. I personally think they smell wonderful!",5
"My wife really likes this perfume by Shakira! It has a nice sweet scent, with a hint of spice. It’s an incredibly sexy scent that I love too! ❤️ It doesn’t last the whole day, however if you reapply in the afternoon, it does. The bottle is beautiful too! Just looks weird with my wife grabbing Shakira’s bod and spraying. 😂 We got a good laugh out of it!",5
"This 4 piece hair set is great! My wife has wavy hair, as well as my daughter, and myself. My son has long, curly, coarse hair. This set works on all of our hair types! The largest hollowed our brush is great for blow drying. The smaller comb/brush is designed to remove tangles from curly hair, and it works well when using with detangling spray. There is a small attachment included, which hooks onto the back of the brush to keep the bristles together. You also get a wide tooth comb and a parting comb. Everything included in the set is lightweight and easy to hold. It’s a great set at an amazing price!",5
"This hand sanitizer by Puretize is great. During the time of the pandemic, this is a must! It contains 70% alcohol, which is great to kill those nasty germs 🦠! It smells similar to rubbing alcohol, however it’s not too strong. I love this hand sanitizer as it doesn’t dry out my hands like others. Every family needs a bottle of this in their home!",5
"My wife has been using this product for about a week and likes it. It’s very easy to apply, just like clear liquid eyeliner. It’s good that it does not irritate my wife’s sensitive skin at all. She has tried on her lashes and has noticed a slight difference in the thickness of them. I am sure that time will bring more dramatic results. The product is a bit pricey for the amount you get though.",4
My wife is very happy with this facial cleanser. It’s very moisturizing and makes her skin feel baby soft after using. It barely has a scent to it and it works great on her sensitive skin.,4
My wife loves this stuff! She has been using for a few days and loves the scent! Smells a mix of rose and orange.. beautiful and very uplifting. It makes her skin feel hydrated and more firm. Very nice product!,5
These are so nice and easy to apply. You instantly feel the moisture in your skin from the moment you put them on. After taking them off you notice that it really helps with the bags! My wife has used a few times and has already noticed a difference! They are even more refreshing when cold! Just keep them in your fridge!,5
"Having used this for 2 months now I really am seeing a difference.  My skin has always been good, and I have taken care of it for most of my life, so I had a good place to start from, but I am beginning to see the crowsfoot lines fading, the dark shadows fading, and the general quality of skin even nicer.<br />FYI I am very fair skinned (red hair, white skin, green eyes type of Irish) so not sure how it would work on dark skin, especially African, but it doesn't feel like it's corrosive so might be OK.<br />You really only need a fingerprint's worth for each eye area, so it is going to last a long time.  In 2 months I am less than half way through the jar.",5
"WOW a comb that is truly smooth and seam-free, does not snag my long wavy hair, and smells nice.  Seems to work well on wet and dry hair.  It seems very sturdily made, but I am going to buy another just in case.  I just wish they made one with longer tins, as the heavy duty plastic one I had been using before had longer tines and it felt good going through my hair especially when wet.  But this is still a very nice product.",5
"5&#34; is way too long for my waist-length thick hair.  The spikes stick out the far side of whatever updo I have going, and make the whole thing look amateurish and unfinished.  If these came in 2.5 or 3&#34; they'd be great but they are simply too long.",3
"I thought with my short hair this would look bad, but, it's actually quite bohemian sheek!<br />Love it! It may not be for everyone, but it's for me!",5
As described & fast ship!,5
"I have been looking at the name brand wet skin shower, moisturizers and chose this because of the kind of ingredients it has and doesn't have. Reading the contents of the labels of Jergen's, Nivea, etc., I discovered many ingredients I did not want to use on my skin. I couldn't pronounce most of them, let alone use them on my body. Thank you for making this product.  Please make it in a larger size. I will be using this up quickly!",5
I use this to remove eye makeup. Especially mascara. It is not oily and has no scent. It doesn't sting my eyes and takes off everything. I don't use waterproof mascara but my eyeliner and cream based shadows are along with eyebrow makeup.,5
"I really liked this palette a lot. The colors are bold and beautiful; and a really fun change to my routine for not a lot of money. I found that colors blend out easily and last all day too. I honestly couldn't think of one bad thing to say about this set other than that my palette didn't come sealed. Cosmetic products should always be sealed in my opinion, so I had to deduct a star. But otherwise I would have to recommend it.<br />(soda can included in the photo for size reference)",4
I have been using GrandeLash for over a year now with a lot of success. So I don't know how this product works for first time users. The only thing I can say is that this product is maintaining the outgrowth I have from using the other brand just fine. I haven't had any eye stigmas or irritaton from this serum either. I have been using it for over a month now and I like it a lot. I would have to recommend it.,5
"Everyone comments on the smell of this putty, and it DOES smell very nice.<br />However, that is not the reason I would buy hair products. I purchase for the shine and the hold.<br />As advertised, this is a medium shine, medium hold putty.<br />It goes in nice and thick/sticky and holds well throughout the day. It looks more natural, not like you gooped a bunch of gel in your hair. This brand is new to me, but it is performing well so far, and I would recommend giving it a try!",5
"Finally, something that’s natural!! This beard balm is beyond amazing. It feels great on my skin and the minty smell to it really wakes me up in the mornings. I haven’t been able to find something that works and feels as great as this beard bomb so this defiantly gets a thumbs up for me.",5
went well with what I needed it for,5
"I like these very much. Good generous size, very soft when wet, nice natural sponges. With care they should last as expected. Glad I bought them.",5
good natural soap,5
Does not work for short hair,1
useless. keeps falling DON'T BUY,1
"best scrubbers I have ever used,  They last a long time.  somewhat abrasive helps remove the dead skin cells and invigorate my skin.  Feels really good to use it.  Flat and long enough that I can thoroughly scrub my back. I have been a fan of these style scrubbers for over 20 years.",5
Just the right touch of color for cheeks.  Blends easily.........i love this product.,5
Worked great for a short while then the vibration stopped working. Still is a good brush.,5
Plug in is way to big for our outlets. Never seen a plug like this. Wish I could of used it.,1
Really like the shower cap,5
Perfect size,5
 ,1
The teeth are sturdy and the sides do not pinch.  I like these alot,5
"the handle is a little short  I've only used it once but it held up so, I'm keeping it.",3
Returned as there was no indication that the product was actually organic.,2
Arrived broken,1
These don't do the trick.  1-2 uses okay but I have since purchased the gloves that work much better!,3
B+,3
Love these clips. I use them all the time to help part my hair into sections for ironing. They can also help keep my twisted bun stay in place for a car ride over before I let the curls loose. I can't wear it all day because my hair is too heavy for the clips.,5
Amazing coverage.  Just use a very small amount.  A little goes a long way.  I have aging skin and brown spots.  It covered the spots wonderfully and feels light on my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this foundation does not irritate my skin.,5
Works just like I was hoping.  Really good product.,5
"Nice creamy feel, goes on smoothly. Covers lightly not like foundation. It just improves the texture and evens out my skin tone.<br />I will buy this again.",5
"Maybe I don't know how to use this properly, but it is a hot mess on my eyebrows. Tried wiping the wand completely off and it still made a mess.",3
"I'm mad I didn't buy this kind of mask sooner, but maybe I was hoping the madness would stop. Here we are a year later. These are so so thin, very soft, and very breathable. I just ordered more colors for me and my kid. I only wear masks when forced and it kills me that my kid has to wear one all day at school. Usually I cut the extra layers out of the cotton ones, but it is still too hot and makes me feel like I'm smothering. These are great. Highly recommend.",5
My Husband Loves it... firm bristles soothes his scalp,5
I like this because it is small compact and easy to use,5
"It's fantastic -  if your deodorant ""stops working"" - give this a try!  It's thick and a little tough to apply BUT it works!  It works for women, men and stinky teenage guys!  The name is funny - bonus!",5
Super cute. It’s just a thin shower cap made of plastic but I use it work work as a nurse. Got lots of compliments on it.,5
"These are pretty nice but pretty sparse. If you’re doing a natural look they work great, not for glam.",4
"I got this little dish for doing my nails and for working with paint. It’s a great size, the lid is nice at blocking fumes and it seems like it wouldn’t break if dropped on carpet.",5
"Extremely disappointed the bottle is damaged, and doesn’t stand up it wobbles",1
Thank you for thinking of this.,5
It’s a necessary cleaning product when your groomer.<br />I haven’t had a chance to use it but I’m sure it’s fine,5
"These nail files are really made well - are comfortable to hold, and have almost limitless buffing grit.  They’re double-sided.  It’s great to have a supply of these for the purse, bathroom and in baskets  we keep In both the kitchen and living room in case we need one!  Purple color is pretty - makes them easy to find in the purse!  Good choice!",5
"I wondered how my older teeth would take to this - would it be too strong, and wipe out all my fillings!  Actually, it has become a necessary part of my dental care - it removes “stuff” a toothbrush could never dislodge - and is a much more pleasant way to have a really clean mouth without the gyrations of dental floss.  Just so much easier to use than dental floss - and you get a better result.  Very pleased with this.  Haven’t traveled with it - I pack light for long weekends.",5
"This grandma had no idea how popular these items are.  My granddaughter (28) was overjoyed to receive one, so evidently they are the newest item in the fight against wrinkles.  She knew all about them, how to use them and what results one expects after a period of use.  This makes a great gift for ladies of 16 or older!",5
"Works smoothly and makes the face and neck feel like it’s had a facial!  That stimulation does give the skin a healthy glow, and makes you feel really clean.  Have been using it for two weeks - a couple times a week, and there is a difference in the softness of my aging skin.  No more dry skin flakes - so it’s exfoliating and exposing fresh-looking skin.  Never had one before - but now, I’m a fan!",5
This is a great hair mask that helps protect your color treated hair. It contains some good ingredients that will nourish and hydrate your hair. It comes in a cute little jar and smells fantastic.<br /><br />The mask works very well. It doesn't change your hair color but enhances the life of your color and makes your hair look fantastic. It also helps prevent fading to some degree and makes my colored hair last longer. All in all very happy with this hair mask and I use this about once every week to 10 days.,5
"We all know about this issue so I figured I would give it a shot, why not right? Well sadly I was not too impressed to be honest. My rear was nicely moisturized for sure but I didn't really see any improvement in regards to acne and blackheads to be honest. It was worth a shot though but it does work quite nicely as a moisturizer but there are other, cheaper products for that that I like better tbh. At least it wasn't greasy so you could go on your merry day right away.",3
"MORe di Croatia makes some very nice products. This eye cream comes in a beautiful little frosted glass jar. It has a lovely fragrance that I for one really like a lot.<br /><br />The cream itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. I find that it leaves no residue on the skin behind and makes the skin feel very soft and moisturized. The skin looks great and feels amazing. At $20 this is a good price as well. I can only recommend this one since it seems to help reduce under eye puffiness, not so much the dark circles though but I do like how my skin looks overall.",4
This is a great little starter kit to do your own nails at home. It is a dip powder kit that is very easy to use and has everything you need to do your own nails. You don't even need an LED lamp to do your nails.<br /><br />It has amazing colors that I really like and is perfect for those who want to do their own nails. All in all really happy with this.,4
This is a nice lip scrub by Simply Dana. It tastes of coconut which I personally really like. It works very well helping to exfoliate the lips in a gentle manner.<br /><br />Especially in the winter my lips are rougher shape and need a little extra help and this gets the job done.,5
"This Glam Pearl Serum is very nice but does not come cheap. It comes in a beautiful bottle with a pump dispenser on the top. This allows you to dispense the small quantities you need, which is great since you don't want to waste this product.<br /><br />The serum itself is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves no residue behind on the skin and leaves the skin soft and smooth. I find that the skin has a healthy glow to it and looks great. All in all I really like this.",4
"This face serum by Carla comes in a beautiful glass bottle that has a pump dispenser on the top. It is a dual serum so make sure you mix it well before you dispense it since it tends to separate.<br /><br />It has a gel like consistency almost and is lightweight. It absorbs quickly but the skin does feel a bit sticky after it is applied. That feeling fades after about 5 to 10 minutes or so. Once it is faded the skin feels soft, smooth and looks great. All in all a great product.",4
"I admit it, I just love hair products by ikoo. For some reason these just really work for my hair.<br /><br />This one is a travel sized conditioner for fine, thin or flat hair and my hair really takes to it. I find it sad though that for this little one they are charging so much. You are much better of getting the regular size and putting that in a travel size container yourself.<br /><br />The conditioner itself smells amazing and I for one really love that. It is smooth and I let it usually work on my hair for like 3 to 5 minutes. The conditioner rinses out with ease and leaves my hair nice and soft. I find that my hair looks fantastic. It is nice and shiny, and it definitely gets a boost in volume, and just has a healthy look and feel to it.",5
This lotion is great. You get 4 smaller sized squeeze bottles of lavender fragranced hand and body lotion. It smells absolutely amazing first off which is one of the reasons these always come with me when I go somehwere. The second reason is they work. When I use them my skin feels fantastic. The lotion is creamy but lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin making my skin feel soft and hydrated. Very happy and for that price there really are no complaints.,5
"This sugar body scrub is amazing. It has an amazing fragrance which is what you will notice first when you open the jar. The scrub is a gentle exfoliator and works very well. It moisturizes as you go along and makes your skin feel soft and smooth. It does have oil in it so that is what makes your skin feel moisturized and you may feel greasy, my recommendation, don't use a ton of it when you use it and start with just a little bit which goes a long way.",4
"This under eye cream comes in a cute little container that looks fantastic. It has retiniol in it that really is great for your skin as well as hyaluronic acid, both that should help with wrinkles. Just a reminder, products with retinol make you more sensitive to sun light so make sure you use sun blockers when using these kinds of products.<br /><br />The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves no residue behind and your skin just feels soft and smooth. The cream has a lovely fragrance that I really like.<br /><br />All in all this is a great find.",4
"This is a lovely sleeping mask that comes in a stunning looking jar. As the name implies it is applied at night so it can do its magic. Inside this jar is a creamy mask that smells amazing and I for one really like this. The mask is on the medium weight side but still absorbs pretty quickly into the skin which is great.<br /><br />The skin definitely feels a bit sticky when you apply this mask to your skin but this is common with sleeping masks. I have a couple who don't but this one does and it is not a big deal since you apply it before you head to bed. The next morning you will love the results. The skin feels soft, smooth and looks radiant. I for one am a fan and happy with the results I can get.",5
"This is a very nice serum. It has sedum extract in it which is supposed to help adding hydration to the skin, which in turn adds firmness and elasticity. It has a low molecular hyaluronic acid which helps adding moisture to the skin and is meant for daily treatment of your face.<br /><br />It has a mild fragrance only and is nice and fresh. I for one do like it quite a bit. This is more like a toner and you use it quite similarly to one. Pour some of it on a cotton pad and gently pad the essence onto your skin until it is fully absorbed.<br /><br />I find it absorbs quickly into the skin. It feels a tad sticky at first but that quickly goes away. My skin does feel nicely moisturized when I use this so I do like this quite a bit. This is a lovely product.",4
"This is a nice intimate wash for women. It is free of alcohol, sulfate and parabens which is great since you don't want those ingredients in there. It is also vegan and plant based which is great. It produces a nice gentle lather that works well and I found I don't need much when I  use it. They made sure that it maintains the natural pH of the skin so you are not prone to infections.<br /><br />The fragrance is ok in my eyes and it works well overall. The price is a bit on the more expensive side considering how much product you get, however considering that it is vegan and all, I think it kind of makes up for it. I am not upset with this product and mine was not expired yet but close, but these types of products can be used at least 3 years past that date so I have no issues with that as well.",4
This is an interesting product for sure. You get a jar with cream that looks very cute in my eyes but that is not all. You also get a multi-care massage applicator that has red light to treat your skin.<br /><br />The cream itself has a lovely fragrance that I really like. It is creamy yet lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. You can then use the multi-care massage applicator and use it to massage the cream into the skin as a special treat really but it also just works the cream better into the skin. Work the cream from the center to the outside and massage for about 3 minutes. Then make sure to clean the applicator.<br /><br />I have to say this is a special way to apply your cream and makes it more like a spa treatment than anything else and really works quite well. The cream has a lot of good ingredients and together this is fantastic. I for one love this and can only recommend it. When you are out of cream you can just get the refill pack without the massager which is great. The price for this was very reasonable as well. All in all very happy with this and it makes for a fantastic gift!,5
"I really like products by Huxley. They tend to be not overpriced and the quality that I found to date is always very good. They always come in packaging that is stylish and looks good.<br />this clay mask is just along the lines and I for one even though clay masks tend to dry out my skin, really like this one.<br /><br />It looks great and this one smells fantastic, one of the things I really like about Huxley products. This clay mask really cleans my skin beautifully and does not dry it out too much. I have normal skin and it does dry it out a little bit but since I always use a good moisturizer afterwards it is not a big deal.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instruction, clean your face, apply an even layer and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. I let it get pretty dry before I rinsed it off with lukewarm water. My skin felt great and was nice and soft after I used this mask. I for one can only recommend this one.",5
"This is an interesting kind of cream. The jar it comes in is very cute. It is a frosted glass jar with some cute print on it that just looks really cute to be honest and I like displaying it in my bathroom. Inside this jar you find a very interesting cream, a water gel cream that I haven't really come across yet and really have to say is neat and interesting. I love using this especially on a hot summer day because it is very refreshing. It is even better yet if you put the cream in the fridge to cool it down, because it feels even more refreshing.<br /><br />This cream absorbs really quickly into the skin. It has a fantastic fragrance of lavender that I am a huge fan of. It is fantastic especially in the evening because it just has a very calming effect on top of the refreshing feel of it. It leaves a slight tack residue on the skin but that goes away in about 5 to 10 minutes, so no big deal. I for one really like this one and it hits every aspect that it should. I use this in the evening and like how my skin looks and feels in the morning. All in all very happy and this is one of the ones I see myself reaching for more often than not.",5
"In this jar you get 30 pairs of marine algae eye patches. The jar is quite pretty and will look good in any bathroom. The eye patches smell great and are rather soothing to be honest. However I have to say paying $24, much cheaper than their green tea version.<br /><br />These work quite nicely and I do really like them. I do like how soothing these are and use them when my under eye area is puffy or is very dark and seems like I have been put through the ringer. These feel even better if you keep them in the fridge, they then have an even more cooling effect.<br /><br />All in all I do really like them, so I will get these instead of their green tea ones from now on.",5
"This is a nice serum by Easydew that comes in a dropper bottle. In it is a DW-EGF protein. It is basically a youth protein that helps your skin with collagen and elastin, basically helps your skin stay soft, smooth, and just look great.<br /><br />This serum is a light to medium consistency that absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn't leave any kind of residue on the skin, it is maybe a bit tacky at first but that goes away quickly. I am not prone to reactions to these kinds of products and didn't have any in this case either.<br /><br />I found this was a great moisturizer and my skin looked soft and smooth overall. This is a nice product and I am satisfied overall. It is also reasonably priced at just $30.",4
"This is a fantastic pack of 12 face masks. You get 2 beauty boosters, 2 best self forward, 2 fresh start, 2 girl’s night in, 2 character face masks and 2 sit back & relax masks. Each has some different ingredients but you will find something that fits what your face is in need of from soothing and calming to helping with inflammation to moisturizing and more. The masks have mild yet pleasant fragrances. The masks themselves are soft and fit very well. This gift set is just $16 so just over a $1 a mask, a great deal really.",5
"This is a pretty nice shampoo. You get a massive bottle of this shampoo that comes in a convenient bottle with a pump dispenser on the top, which personally I prefer since it makes it so much easier to use in the shower especially. The shampoo itself smells very nice, which is a big plus in my eyes.<br /><br />It lathers up very nice and cleanses your with ease. Once you are done the shampoo rinses out quite quickly without any issues. The hair feels nice and clean and I for one am quite happy. This is a pretty good deal and I for one am happy with this.",4
"I have another blackhead remover but that one did not have the camera adapter. I wanted to actually see the details so this one seemed cool so why not? It is very easy to use and I have to say seeing on the phone what was happening was neat. The blackhead remove is very easy to use, similar to the one I already have really. It has different sized heads that allow you to change the pressure that you are applying. The power button turns it on and off but also changes the modes from soft to normal to strong.<br /><br />Make sure you keep it moving or the vacuum can actually cause damage, meaning break some capillaries which will cause a bruise. This will obviously heal but who wants a bruise in the face?<br /><br />I really like this because you can really see what is going on up close. It is easy to use and works well. The price is reasonable and the pairing with the phone (Samsung S20+) worked well.",5
This is a neat little curling iron that does the work for you really. I have tried some different types of curling irons over the year and wanted something easy and simple to use. My hair is quite long these days and when you have longer hair it gets a little bit more complicated I found. So I wanted to give this one a chance and see how it goes. There is definitely a slight learning curve but watch the video and off you go.<br /><br />The temperature adjustment is at the handle and is very easy to use by rotating it. The tip is insulated so you can actually touch it which is a nice added touch in my eyes. There is also an adjustment that lets you switch if it turns left or right when making the curls so you can switch that as well depending on which way you want your curls to go. It comes with 3 different barrels that lets you change the type of curls you get.<br /><br />I found it works quite well and is easy to use. I had no issues with my long hair because it has the long barrel to accommodate all my hair and actually curl it all. All in all I am quite happy with this.,4
This brush fits nicely into the hand but I find that the bristles are pretty soft. If you have a tangled beard this will struggle a bit to get through it to be honest. Also if you have a coarse beard this also may struggle quite a bit. For shorter beards this will work quite well. All in all I find it is overpriced for what you are getting and find it just to be average.,3
This is a nice cream by Simply Dana. It comes in a simple yet elegant glass jar. The cream itself has a pleasant but mild fragrance. The cream itself is very creamy and lightweight. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving behind any residue.<br /><br />The skin feels soft and smooth when you use this cream. I for one like how my skin feels when I use this. It looks nice and just feels moisturized. All in all for a lower priced cream this is not a bad choice.,4
"These crayon eyeshadow sticks are interesting. It definitely takes a little getting used to, to work with them but once you get the hang of them they are a nice way to add color to your eye lids.<br /><br />On one side they have the color crayons and on the other side you have a little brush that helps you work in the eye color. In this set you get 6 beautiful colors in the purple scheme which is great. The colors are pretty rich in pigment and they blend quite nicely. All in all I am quite happy with this and for $12 this is not a bad price at all. It is an easy way to create an eye look with just one or two of these.",5
"I admit, I am a fan of Maelys products. They just know how to do cosmetics right. This Neck & Decollete Firming Cream is fantastic. It comes in a beautiful frosted glass jar that looks great on every bathroom shelf. Inside of it is this amazing smelling firming cream that you will be thankful you got.<br /><br />This cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. Once it is absorbed it leaves no residue behind. Instead the skin just feels soft and smooth. My skin feels and looks amazing, exactly what I am asking a product like this to do. I for one am sold and I love this cream, one of the ones I tend to reach for.",5
"In this pack you get 7 masks for just over $42, so these run you for over $6 a masks. These are on the more expensive side of the spectrum but not yet the most expensive ones I have tried. This is an interesting set of masks that provides you with 6 different types of masks and a double for the hydrating type. You get 2 hydrating masks, one brightening, one clarifying, one anti-oxidant, one exfoliating and one renewal mask. These masks should really cover all you need which is great. They are free of toxins, so no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oil and castor oils. In addition they are biodegradable which is great.<br /><br />These are some nice masks that fit quite nicely and have a good amount of serum on them. I found that they actually have a nice pleasant fragrance that does differ from mask to mask based on the ingredients.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 20 to 30 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. The fit of the mask is very nice so no complaints there. Overall my face felt and looked great after I used it. Being able to address different issues with these different masks in nice, however I didn’t really see that much of an improvement with just one mask to be honest. But my face did feel great after I used these masks since they were nicely hydrated and felt refreshed after each use.",5
"In this pack you get 3 masks for $18, so this is one on the more expensive face sheet masks that I have tried. I like that it is biodegradable since we really should do more for our environment so I find this to me a big plus. This mask has some very nice ingredients in it like Vitamin C that is from pineapple and others. It is free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, gluten, formaldehyde and vegan friendly.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. My face was a bit sticky afterwards but that feeling did go away after about  minutes or so. The serum in the mask had a pleasant smell that I did like a lot. My face felt nicely moisturized when I used this mask and looked great. All in all this is a great mask I just wish it was not as expensive to be honest since it is not on the cheap sice to be used weekly.",5
"In this pack for just over $7 you get 3 different colored hair clips and 2 each color, and then 7 hair ties. The hair clips are gold, silver and black and just beautiful. The hair ties are a plain black. These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did. I have long, but thin hair, thin in density and thin in thickness and this hair clip worked just fine. I had no issues gathering just a section or the entire hair together. Even though the clips are flat in the front I had no issues at all working with these, they are actually quite easy to work with and fit quite comfortably in the hair. The size is big enough to fit my entire hair or just parts of it. They are cute and lovely and the price is not excessive, they are actually inexpensive if you ask me.",5
"In this pack for just over $7 you get 3 different colored hair clips and 2 each color, and then 7 hair ties. The hair clips are light blue, a copper and a brown and just beautiful. The hair ties are a light brown, kind of not a great color to be honest but oh well didn’t get these clips for the ties.<br /><br />These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did.

"This facial cream comes in a beautiful frosted glass jar. When you open the jar, the cream inside of it is not one of those lotion types but more a butter type of cream, very solid and almost waxy. Don’t be alarmed it did not go rancid or bad, that is just how this cream is. You will scoop some of it out and will notice it actually smells pretty good. With the heat of your skin it also starts to liquify somewhat and makes it easier to apply to your skin.<br /><br />At this point it absorbs pretty easily and quickly into the skin. There were no issues there at all. I for one really liked this cream and it absorbs fully without leaving any residue behind on the skin. The skin actually feels soft and smooth and smells great, sadly only for a few minutes though since the fragrance does fade fairly quickly, but the softness stays. My skin felt moisturized and was rather happy. All in all this is a great little find.",4
"Fountain of Truth has some interesting products, some I have liked and others that I was just not convinced of. I am happy to say that this one is definitely worth the money. It comes in a tall small applicator with little metal ball applicators. You have to push the top down to expel the product on the top, right by the little metal eye rollers. The under eye cream smells ok, somewhat medicinal, herbal, not bad but not the best either but I can handle it.<br /><br />You use those eye rollers to massage it into the skin which is neat and I personally like it since it does help firming the skin. I prefer to put it into the fridge prior to using it since the cooling helps even more, at least I found it does in my case. This cream absorbs quickly, I do use my fingers in the end to make sure everything is fully absorbed, but it does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin. This stays for some time so I would recommend using this in the evening because of that.<br /><br />All in all this is a very nice product. Yes it is not cheap but this should last you a very long time to be honest since you really don’t need much at all every time you use this.",4
"I have no idea how anyone can make a body wash with mango wrong, but they did and it is such a letdown. This one is one of the worst body washes I have ever use and it was such a disappointment, I don’t think I will even use up the rest of the bottle. I like that it comes in a convenient pump dispenser bottle but that and the price are about all I like about this product.<br /><br />The body wash smells horrible and I found it really doesn’t cleanses at all. I actually had a lipstick stain on the back of my hand that I wanted to get rid of and it could NOT get rid of it, like come one really? I don’t think getting rid of a lipstick is that difficult, any kind of soap or cream based product can do it but this body wash could not. I was not sure if I was even clean using this so I had to use something else on the important parts of the body just to make sure.<br /><br />Even at $5 this is not worth it since it doesn’t even smell great. This is a complete failure and I can’t recommend this at all, sorry I just can’t. At least you know it is super mild since it doesn’t even attack dirt.",2
"You get 2 massive bottles of oil, one with sweet almond oil and the other with coconut oil. For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal",4
"This set of lipsticks is such a gimmick but man I really like them. They are meant to look like a box of cigarettes and the 4 lipsticks are actually pretty small, also meant to look like little cigarettes. This set of 4 will run you about $10 which is not a bad deal to be honest.<br /><br />The little bullet style lipsticks all have very similar tones to be honest but are just different enough that you can distinguish them. They are very easy to apply and you can get a nice pointy application with them which is great. They are surprisingly smooth and creamy and have a good taste to them. They have a pretty good staying power, again it was a bit surprising to be honest. They wear not bad in the waterproof department but did wear off a bit on cups and mugs.<br /><br />All in all I was impressed by these and think these would make for a great little gag gift, especially for young adults dabbling into makeup but also for others as well that are looking for a lipstick that goes well into the purse and gives them options.",4
"I really wanted to like this facial serum. It comes in a little dropper bottle that is common for this kind of product. The serum is a prickly pear oil that is supposed to be very good for your face.<br /><br />When you use it you will first notice the fragrance of the oil. I am not sure if maybe my bottle went bad, but mine just smelled very bad, almost like oil that went rancid. I really didn’t like it at all and it makes it difficult using this product especially since that smell lingered for some time on top of it.<br /><br />The oil is on the lighter side, and even so it took a while to absorb and my skin felt greasy for some time. I would not recommend using this during the day. Especially when wearing a mask, using a facial oil that leaves an oily residue makes my face very hot and sweaty, just awful and this one would do exactly that. Sadly this one is just average at best and I will not be re-purchasing when I run out.",3
"When I received this leave-in conditioner I was a bit confused. I expected to receive a pump dispenser but when I got the product it was in a jar. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed since I do prefer the pump dispenser but oh well, just wish they would actually show the real product to be honest. The leave-in conditioner itself smells fantastic so that is a huge plus.<br /><br />When you then dip into the jar to get some of the conditioner out, it is actually pretty thin and runny, which was quite a surprise to me to be honest. Taking a leave-in conditioner out of a jar is a bit of a challenge to be honest. Doing a pump or two is just so much easier. I found that this conditioner left a residue on my hair that I did not care for. It also weighed my hair down that just was undesirable as well. I for one am not a huge fan of this one and can’t recommend this conditioner, I just don’t like it sadly because my hair just didn’t look good, nor felt great. At least it is not expensive and it may work for others but this just didn’t work for me at all.",2
"Dr. Au Anti Aging Face Oil took me a little bit by surprise to be honest. This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can’t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.",5
This shampoo by Mr. Zaranda was just average in my eyes. I had higher hopes for it but it is what it is. It comes in a generous large pump dispenser bottle that is beautiful. The shampoo is just an average smelling product but again that is not what determines the rating of my review.<br /><br />Inside of the bottle is a shampoo that produces an average lather. I let it sit in my hair for a while whenever I use it to make sure the working ingredients can do their job. It rinses out quite easily so no issues there. I felt my hair just looked ok when I use it and haven’t noticed any effects in regards to their promises. There hasn’t been an increase of hair loss. There is maybe a little bit less hair loss when it comes to when I am in the shower I notice maybe a little bit less hair in the drain. Other than that I really don’t see that much effect when I use it. But it is not expensive and it is not a bad shampoo. Because of all of that I rate this as an average shampoo.,3
"I am quickly becoming a fan of products from EasyDew. This cleanser comes in a very nice pump dispenser. When you use it you will first notice that it has a lotion like consistency which is unusual for cleansers. Next you will notice the incredible fragrance it has that I absolutely love, especially for facial products fragrances are very important to me and this one is fantastic.<br /><br />This cleanser is super gentle I found. After I am done my skin feels soft and smooth and not dried out at all. It actually feels almost like I moisturized it. I do still follow up with a moisturizer but you could do without one if you were in a rush.",5
"This is a very nice sheet face mask. When you open the package the mask is loaded with the mask which is nice, but it is not dripping which you don’t want. You notice the fantastic fragrance of the mask, very strong of honey which I love. It is very smooth and smells incredible in my eyes.<br /><br />The material of the sheet is very nice and soft. I found it is a bit big however so it does take some adjustment to be honest to make it fit. I do prefer that over a mask being too small however. Make sure to clean your face prior to using it, just like the instructions say. You leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove it. Any residual serum is just gently massaged into the skin.<br /><br />I found that my skin loves this mask. It feels nice and soft, smooth and just looks nicely moisturized. It has a natural glow to it that says I did something good for it. It does feel a bit sticky for about 5 minutes right after, but that goes away and then you are left with soft and smooth skin. In this box, that btw is perfect as a gift as well, you get 10 masks for just $24, which I think is a very good price and allows you to do something good for your skin for some time.",5
"This intensive moisturizer by Easydew is a very nice cream and runs you $45. I would still consider this a mid-range priced product for the quantity you are getting. It comes in a simplistic looking squeeze tube, that almost looks medicinal in my eyes.<br /><br />The cream has a very pleasant fragrance that I personally really like. The cream itself is a medium weight in my eyes and does take a little bit to absorb into the skin fully. It does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin that takes some time to fully disappear. Because of this I would recommend this as an evening cream because you wouldn’t want to apply foundation over it, nor would you want to wear a face mask all day while having that on your skin. I found that products like this make me sweat quite heavily under face masks.<br /><br />I use this in the evenings and do find that in the morning my skin looks nicely moisturized, is soft and smooth. So it does look exactly as I would expect it to with this kind of product. To achieve all this you really don’t need that much of the product either which is great because it is not the cheapest product, however also not the most expensive either. All in all I do really like this but only like using this in the evening.",4
"This is a nice inexpensive body wash. It comes in very nice packaging to be honest and makes for a great gift, especially with the holidays coming up. They also have the matching body lotion and all. The body wash comes in a generous bottle that has a pump dispenser on the top that makes it very easy to use especially when you are in the shower.<br /><br />The body wash has a nice fragrance that is very pleasant. It does linger while you are in the shower but once you are all rinsed off, sadly it doesn’t last too long after that. The body wash does produce a decent lather but sadly it is not too luxurious. All in all for the price that you are paying, which is less than $15, this is a pretty nice find.",4
"This FillUp by EasyDew is a great cream that I personally really like a lot. First of it comes in a stunning squeeze tube that has a one of those interesting tips for a more concentrated spot application. This pretty silver tube will look great on any bathroom shelf really. It is meant for spot treatment for wrinkles and contains hyaluronic acid to help with that with lots of moisture to be added to the skin but other ingredients as well to help with all of that.<br /><br />This cream has a very nice but mild fragrance that I do like. The cream is very lightweight. That tip allows precise spot application to where you want and need to put it and allows small application of the product. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive less than $25 so for me this one is a winner.",5
"I really like this retinol serum by Simple Elegance. It comes in a classic looking pump dispenser. Keep in mind, when you use products containing retinol, your skin is more sensitive to sun light so make sure to use sun protection when you go outside.<br /><br />This serum smells amazing and I for one really like that a lot about this product. The serum itself is almost like a cream and very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves hardly any residue behind, and what it does pretty much disappears quickly. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive at $30 so for me this one is a winner.",5
This is a nice facial emulsion. It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works well to dispense the small quantities you need for your face. It has a mild yet pleasant fragrance. The emulsion itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin.<br /><br />At first the face was a bit sticky and I was not crazy about how my face felt. But that changed rather quickly and I was impressed on how my face felt. It felt smooth and soft and just looked nicely moisturized. I for one really liked how this emulsion makes my face feel. This is not bad for an inexpensive facial emulsion. Pretty pleased with this actually.,4
"This is a nice toner. It comes in a nice tall bottle. It doesn’t have some kind of dispensation mode, just a little whole that you pour the toner out from. It is easiest to use cotton pads to use this toner with so that seems to work the best.<br /><br />The toner has a mild but pleasant fragrance. That scent does not linger though. It seems that this toner is very mild. I have had no reactions to it. It felt moisturizing and did not dry out my skin. I do find this to be maybe a bit overpriced though to be honest at $31.",4

his is a nice moisturizer for men but in my eyes could also be used for women. It is pretty much fragrance free which makes it great for people who are sensitive to fragrances. It comes in a very classic black squeeze tube. This moisturizer is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. There is no residue left behind on the skin either which is great. The skin feels nicely moisturized which is exactly as it should. This is also not an expensive product which makes it perfect.,4
"This is an above average moisturizer by Black Wolf. You get a fairly small white squeeze bottle that contains the moisturizer. You don’t need a lot of the product when you use it. It has a very nice and lovely fragrance that I do like and is fairly gender neutral, but I think it is definitely more appropriate for men than women.<br /><br />The moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave a greasy feeling on the skin though that takes some time to dissipate. Because of that I would recommend this for evening use. It is very moisturizing though so I am happy with that. My skin did look and feel great once the product was completely absorbed into the skin and the sticky feeling was gone. It is fairly inexpensive at just below $20.",3
"I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Luminous Face oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with pomegranate oil, cacao oil infused with white peony root, marigold flower and lotus leaf. This particular blend is supposed to be brightening, soothing, regenerating, purifying and reduce the appearance of dullness. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It provided some moisture but I didn’t really see a brightening effect to be honest, however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other brighteners that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.",3

This particular blend is supposed to help protect your skin against environmental stressors and resulting in youthful looking skin while hydrating it. When you use this you will notice this serum it has the most pleasant fragrance of the 4 that I have and is actually pleasant and not as reminiscent of an essential oil as the others are.<br /><br />It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin. When I use this my skin feels nice and soft, very smooth and definitely looks beautifully hydrated, thanks hyaluronic acid.  Is this really worth the price?

"This toner is not inexpensive, but you do get a larger bottle when you receive this toner that is almost $40. The box that it comes in is rather beautiful and the bottle itself is also very classy looking. The bottle itself is a pump dispenser. I usually use a cotton pad when I apply a toner but for this one I just used my fingers instead. The toner is a liquid formula that is on the thicker side with a hint of gel in it almost.<br /><br />This toner contains polyphenols which are actually micro nutrients and good for you, I know it sounds bad so I had to look it up. It also contains sea buckthorn fruit oil that helps brighten the skin complexion and recover from skin fatigue. It contains lily flower extract that helps moisturize the skin and nourish the skin and cherry on top, it contains no parabens.<br /><br />So now when you use it, you notice it has an interesting consistency, somewhat between watery and gel like and it bubbles when you dispense it. It has a very pleasant scent that I really like a lot and this fragrance lingers quite a bit which I am all in favor of. I feel that it nicely moisturized my skin. It didn’t irritate my skin or anything and worked nicely for me. All in all I am very happy with this toner.",5
"This is an expensive facial moisturizer at $60. It comes in a little squeeze tube that has a pump dispenser opening, which are personally my favorite because I think these are just too neat. They claim  a visibly smoothing of wrinkles which I personally can’t say that I have seen happening.<br /><br />This moisturizer is light to medium weight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so. It has a decent fragrance that reminds me of essential oils, probably because it contains hemp and some other ingredients that would fall into that category that have that kind of fragrance. The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn’t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest. So I can recommend this for a moisturizer but not really for a wrinkle remedy. Downside, it is pretty expensive and I have moisturizers that are less expensive and also have a better fragrance.",4
"I have always been a fan of Taya hair products. I found though that this duo is not one of my favorites. In this pack you get a shampoo and conditioner that are basically travel size for $14. They are a bit bigger than you would get at a hotel for example so you get quite a few applications out of them, but for $14 I find this to be rather expensive to be honest.<br /><br />The bottles are pretty cute and look nice. When I used the shampoo I have to say I was disappointed by the fragrance. Usually this line has a fantastic fragrance but this one just wasn’t it. It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this. I am sorry I just wasn’t impressed with this set, especially since you can get the full sized ones for a similar price really.",3
"This is a fantastic Leave-in hair serum. It is not too expensive at $25 since you get a nice sized bottle and you really don’t need a lot of this serum when you use it. You then distribute this serum in your hair and when you do that you notice the incredible fragrance of this serum. It is probably my FAVORITE fragrance in my hair products. Its this amazing mix of tropical fruit and this something that is just amazing! It is hard to try out other things when all I want it is this one.<br /><br />It comes in this easy to use pump dispenser and you just do a couple of pumps and distribute that in your palms. Then distribute all then evenly into your hair that is either wet or damp. Your hair is easy to brush through at that point, not a tangle in sight. Once my hair was dry it was soft, light and shiny. Everything it promised it would do. My hair just looked amazing and felt soft.  I love this product, it smells amazing, my hair looks incredible with lots of shine and lift to it, and it just feels amazing, soft and smooth. I can’t say enough good things about this!",5
"This is an interesting face mask. You get 5 masks for $20 so an ok price, maybe slightly more expensive than usual. You apply this mask to a clean face like you always do.  When you open the package you find 2 masks in it, they split the mask up into 2, the top and bottom.<br /><br />This mask is the first cream mask I have ever used. You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.",4
"In this box you get a set of 12 lipsticks. These are supposed to be matte lipsticks but I found they are borderline matte to satin lipsticks really. These will only run you about $10 so definitely on the cheap side. Each lipstick comes in a little plastic container that has a Halloween themed print on it. They are fairly cheap but again, getting 12 lipsticks for $10 I don’t have high expectations.<br /><br />I found there is some range in colors but not a big one. There are some darker colors and some lighter colors and then the rest all was somewhat similar. I was a bit disappointed by the colors really, but then again, for the price can I really say anything about that? There weren’t really any nudes in there.<br /><br />The lipsticks were easy to apply but not that creamy. However they feel ok on the lips. They are not very sticky or anything but also don’t feel super smooth or creamy on the lips either. They feel just ok really. They don’t taste or smell of anything. Their staying power is ok, they wear off as you eat and drink like a lot of lipsticks do really. So considering these costs $10 for 12 of them, they are not horrible. They feel ok on the lips, the color range is limited in my eyes but they are not bad at all, all considering. Keeping everything in mind, I am rating them at 3 stars.",3
"We have now all been dealing with COVID for some time now and sadly have gotten used to wearing masks. At work I have to wear these types of surgical face masks as part of our PPE in the lab. When I saw these for this price I figured it was worth getting to have some disposable ones around. I have some cloth masks but they should be washed and when I forget or they are in the wash it is nice to have a back up.<br /><br />You get this convenient box with 50 disposable masks in it. I really like that you get this in a box so they are easy to use. In the box you get 5 bags of 10 masks each which is great. So you can actually take one of these bags and keep them where you need them, very convenient.  These are similar to the ones we use at work and these work. These fit well and are comfortable. They get the job done and protect me while I am out and about and need to be protected. It is a strange world right now but I am glad we have ways to get these kinds of masks right now. They do have the little metal clip on the nose so you can make them fit properly which a lot of people don't usually do for some odd reason, but especially if you have glasses you really should take advantage of that. The loops around the ears were plenty big so no complaints there.",5
"I really like this shampoo by Giovanni. I was not sure what to expect to be honest, but I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of time when these shampoos contain tea tree and hemp their fragrance is not the greatest, but this one was shockingly impressive and really good. The fragrance of this one was actually really good and you can barely smell the tea tree which is great. I only smelled hints of it while it was on my hair.<br /><br />This shampoo produces a nice lather that wasn’t too rich but plenty to get my hair nice and clean. I didn’t feel like I needed a lot of it to get my hair nice and clean. I did let it sit for a couple of minutes to let it do “its thing”.  It rinsed out very easily and left nothing behind in my hair. My hair felt nice and clean and looked great. I followed up with a leave-in conditioner afterward still but my hair could have handled not using one after this shampoo. All in all I am very happy with this one and can recommend it.",5
"I have used a few products by Follain to this date so I was curious to see how this mattifying moisturizer would perform. It comes in a little pump dispenser. It is on the more inexpensive side of the spectrum. The design is in line with the rest of the product line. The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized. It felt smooth to the touch but looked good. All in all I was pretty impressed and liked how my face felt and looked when I use this moisturizer.",5
"This is a nice baby bath oil by Emilia. I like that it has organic ingredients since babies tend to be more sensitive still. It is itch-free and hypoallergenic as well. It also has oatmeal extract in it which is known to be soothing.<br /><br />It has a pleasant scent reminiscent of clean baby in my eyes. When you use this the skin feels moisturized afterwards without having used a moisturizer. But the skin does not feel greasy or oily which is great since I am not a fan of that feeling.  You also don’t need to use a lot of this in order to get the benefits of the product. And yes I admit, I actually like using this on myself. It just makes my skin feel great and look fantastic.",4
"This is the first natural deodorant that has actually worked for me. It contains no aluminum or any other other ""chemical"" ingredients. It is baking soda and some other natural ingredients and I have to say this one actually works.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant fragrance of lavender that I really like and is the reason I choose this one in particular. That fragrance lingers for quite some time. It works very well protecting from sweat and odor. I was pleasantly surprised how well it actually worked. The price for this is reasonable and in line with another leading natural aluminum free deodorant.",5
This is a very nice shampoo. You get a huge bottle for just $16 containing argan oil which is great for your hair. I like that this bottle has a pump dispenser which makes it just so much easier to dispense the shampoo in the shower.<br /><br />The shampoo has a very pleasant scent that I like a lot. It produces only a medium lather but it still works quite well to clean your hair. I personally prefer a nice rich lather with my shampoos. It rinses out very easily and leaves you with squeaky clean hair. My hair looked good when I used this and I have no complaints there. All in all this is a very nice inexpensive shampoo containing argan oil which I do like for my hair.,4
"I was a bit surprised how small the bottle of shampoo was since it costs almost $20. But I admit the shampoo itself is very nice. First of you will notice how fantastic it smells. It produces a very nice lather that distributes beautifully throughout your hair. I let it sit in for a little bit since it is supposed to help you with your hair, making it thicker and richer.<br /><br />It rinses out with ease leaving your hair squeaky clean. I do follow it with a conditioner but overall my hair did look and feel fantastic when I use this shampoo. When you use it you don't need a lot of it so thankfully this bottle should last you a good amount.",4
"This is a very nice facial massager that I really like. It comes with 2 different rollers for your face. This one actually can be battery powered if you are so inclined. The rose quartz rollers are very cooling on your face and you could actually remove the heads, since I wouldn't put the electric part in the fridge, you can put the heads alone in the fridge for extra cooling. This will amplify the effects of this massager and help massage away the puffiness in your face.<br /><br />This is one fantastic find and for just $21, you can find some for a little less than that but I really like the design of this one. This helps on those really tough mornings to massage away the puffiness and help your face shed of some years. Perfect for a gift as well.",4
"I really like products from L'ange. This leave in conditioner is no different. It is not cheap at $22 since the bottle is fairly small but the product in it is very good and you don't need a whole lot of it so that does make up for it.<br /><br />This leave in detantler comes in a nice mister bottle. The mister on it is actually very nice and pretty fine allowing you to distribute the product very nicely onto your hair, and therefore you don't need that much of it. It smells absolutely fantastic and does exactly what it promises. I have absolutely not tangles in my hair when I use this.<br /><br />My hair is nice and soft and looks just great. This is a great product to you use for your hair. When dry my hair is still very manageable and looks great. I really like this a lot and what it does to my hair.",5
"This i a very nice inexpensive soothing cream by I Woke Up Like This. It comes in a cute little jar. You get a little spatula with it that allows you to keep the cream nice and untainted and clean.<br /><br />The cream itself smells absolutely fantastic. I really like the fragrance of this one a lot.  The texture of this one is perfect for soothing. It is not really a cream but a combination of cream and gel. It feels fantastic on your skin and if you keep this chilled it will feel even better yet, especially if your skin is irritated by the sun. I found this works for all kinds of irritations really and really like how my skin feels when I use this.<br /><br />It is very lightweight and absorbs very fast into the skin. There is no residue left behind on my skin when I use this. I am a fan and can only recommend this cream. Your skin will thank you.",5
"This is a nice shimmer. You get a fairly generous container with this shimmer. It is best applied with your finger but will work with a brush as long as you wet it either with water or better with a setting spray to be honest. Make sure when you apply it that you put it in place where you want it. Going over it again tends to make a mess of it.<br /><br />The color is beautiful and I do really like that. It is very pigmented so that is good, just really load up and apply because if you go back and forth it just makes a mess and can flake off.",4
"This is a very expensive  facial oil at $79. It comes in a dark glass bottle to protect the oil inside from light from degradation. The oil itself is applied using a dropper like most really. It is completely scentless which is disappointing but will work well for people sensitive to scents.<br /><br />They claim that it will not leave you with a greasy after feel, well I am not sure what they are talking about. It absorbs quickly but I definitely had a greasy residue on my skin and that stuck with me. I would recommend using this in the evenings only because of this. You wouldn't want to wear a face mask with this greasy feel on your face. You already sweat a lot in those masks and this would make you feel even worse in them. As an overnight moisturizing treatment this does work well though.<br /><br />But would I repurchase at this price? No way, there are other much nice products out there especially at that price.",3
"I have a few products by Higher Education and like the majority of them. This clay mask is fantastic. It comes in a squeeze tube which makes it easy to dispense how much of it you need. They tell you to apply it liberally to your clean skin. When you do that you will notice that fantastic fragrance this has which is great since you will have this on your face for 15 to 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />During that time it will dry out and harden. Once the time is up rinse it warm water. I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br /><br />Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft. A lot of these clay masks tend to dry up your skin but I was impressed that this one did not. It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great. It smells fantastic, is nice and gentle and does not dry you out. There are not a lot of clay masks out there that I do like because most dry my skin out but this one is fantastic.",5
"This facial serum by Dr. Denese is one of the best serums I have used in some time. It comes in a stunning looking dropper bottle. Sadly it does not have a scent but I will look past that. It is also not a cheap serum to be honest but I think this one is worth it.<br /><br />The serum has an oil like consistency and is clear. With the dropper you can apply just a few drops, which is all you need to each side of your face. The serum is very lightweight and it absorbs very quickly into your face and just literally disappears into your skin. It leaves absolutely no residue behind which is odd because it has a real oil like consistency so I expected an oily residue on my skin. Instead I was left with super soft and smooth skin that just felt and looked fantastic. And that is why I just really like this so much.",5
"This is a very nice perfume. It is not too expensive since it is less than $40 which is great. When I got it and sprayed it on I had instant flashbacks of another perfume that I really like. It is very reminiscent of LouLou and when I looked up the fragrance profile for both there is a lot of overlap of the similar top, heart and base notes.<br /><br />I found that this one in comparison is a bit less heavy though and not as overpowering. It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it. This one does have a hint of lightness though that LouLou does not. It does last quite a bit and does not just disappear after a few hours which is nice.<br /><br />The bottle is very cute and oh so Shakira in my eyes. It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.",5
This is a nice facial creme. It does come in a jar which is not my favorite container for facial product because it is not the most hygienic but you can make it work.<br /><br />The cream itself has a nice scent to it that I do like but it does not linger at all. The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. I found that my face had a slight residue but after about 10 minutes that did fade away and I was left with nice and soft skin.<br /><br />As I said I like this facial skin overall and I had no reactions to it. I have normal skin and don't expect any issues in general though. It is a bit expensive and for that I would have expected a slightly better container than this cheap plastic it comes in.,4
This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot. So keeping all this in mind I find this just around average.,3
"This is a pretty nice mascara. It comes in a very nice container that looks great. The wand is a very thin and long wand that makes it easy to apply this mascara to your eye lashes.<br /><br />When you apply this mascara make sure you let it dry properly. Once it is dry, it is definitely smudge and waterproof, no doubt about it but until then you can create a mess if you are not careful.<br /><br />I found that I didn't necessarily get thicker eye lashes when I used them but they definitely looked longer. There was no clumping or flaking which was good. I had no negative reaction to this mascara and my eyes were happy. All in all this is a good one, great for length but no real improvement in regards to thickness.",4
"I have pretty long hair and most people with long hair know the issue with split ends. Last year when I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are a gorgeous minty green. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $13 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten to date so not sure if that is worth it but these are nice and sturdy and made well.",4
"This is a fantastic cleanser by Higher Education. It comes in a very nice squeeze tube that is nice and simple but has a very clean design in line with this product line. The cleanser smells fantastic very refreshing and really amazing, one of my favorites that I have.<br /><br />The cleanser does not produce a heavy lather but I don't really need that. It feels very nice on the face and cleanses gently away anything from your face. It then rinses of nice and easy and you don't have to keep going over it over and over again like some cleansers which is nice.<br /><br />When you are done your face doesn't feel like you have stripped it of all its moisture which is great. It actually still feels pretty moisturized. I still follow it up with my standard moisturizing routine but I didn't feel it was really necessary which was nice so if you forgot your face won't be hurting for it. This is a fantastic cleanser that feels great on the skin and smells amazing, everything I look for in a daily moisturizer especially since it didn't strip my face of its moisture.",5
"I just love these Sigma Lipsticks! In this set you get 4 unique lipsticks that are all in the same color family but the colors are different enough that you actually get 4 different lipsticks and it is worth getting this set for a whopping $75! The colors are 2 beautiful earthy nudes, one more pinky nude and one stunning red tone that is just plain perfect! This is a gorgeous set in regards to colors.<br /><br />Now the applicators are so unique and different and stunning on their own. They also have a magnetic closure of sorts because when you close them they kind of pull shut at the very end so they must have a magnetic closure in it.<br /><br />The lipstick themselves are super creamy and feel amazing on the lips. They have a pleasant taste to them and are just amazing. There is nothing but greatness about them and these are worthy of the name Sigma! I love everything about these and can only recommend this set. Perfect to give as a gift or purchase and breakup and give individual ones as a gift since each are packaged in a box.",5
"This is an interesting concept. You get 15 bubble pads in this container. Each pad is dry though when you get them. You can actually slip your fingers into the pad which makes it easier to use these pads. With these pads you can exfoliate so that is in theory nice but I found in execution it just didn't work as well. The pads didn't have a pleasant scent, well they were actually rather scentless so to me that was rather boring.<br /><br />So when you use them you wet the pads and then clean your face with them. I found that there wasn't as many bubbles as I would have expected from a ""bubble pad"" so that to me was disappointing. They overall cleaned my face ok and I found they didn't dry out my face too much. All in all these worked ok but I wasn't too impressed. You can get a bottle of a nice cleanser for the same price or maybe more but that will last you a lot more than just 15 applications! so to me this is way overpriced and a bit of a waste to be honest.",2
I really like this eye liner. It is not too expensive. It is a nice liquid eye liner that has a nice fine tip. It is easy to use and applies nice and evenly. You could get a wing done with this one without trouble if you have a steady hand because the tip is nice and fine.<br /><br />I have had no issue with smudging with this one which is nice. It is a very nice dark ebony color that looks great. I have gotten some compliments when I have used this because it just makes your eyes look great. It is easy to remove so no problems there.,5
"Oh my, now this is a very nice moisturizer by Higher Education. Even though I am not a fan of skin products coming in jars, this jar is just plain beautiful. This gold digger moisturizer smells amazing and I can't really figure out what it is, but it is the mix of cucumber and melon which is always a winning combination. It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while. So even though it is not the cheapest cream around you still get your money's worth. I like this one, quite a bit and can only recommend it.",5
"This is a nice Retinol cream that is a little expensive considering it contains only 0.5% retinol. I have others that contain 3 times as much and cost half of this one. One word of caution, please keep in mind when you use products containing retinol to use sun blocker and to apply them in the evening since these can make your skin sensitive to sun light.<br /><br />This serum comes in a stunning little plastic squeeze tube looking like upside down pump dispenser. It has a pleasant and mild scent that I really like.<br /><br />The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. There is some residue for a brief while but that goes away pretty quickly. It leaves you with nice soft skin that is smooth and feels great. All in all I really do like this even though it is a bit more on the expensive side for what you get. My skin does like it though and with the lower concentration of the retinol this may work better for people who are more sensitive to retinol.",5
This is a nice little eye shadow palette that contains 16 eye shadows. The palette is actually pretty small but I have yet to use up a palette to be honest so this one will still take a while. You get 5 very nice mattes that are very pigmented and blend out nicely. With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue. So for paying less than $10 this palette is well worth it in my eyes.,5
"I am so torn about this oil. It comes in a glass dropper bottle like most oils come, mostly to protect the oil. Make sure you mix it well since the gold settles on the bottom of it, yes it has actual gold flecks in it. Besides the actual 24k gold it has all natural ingredients making this an actual edible oil. You can use this on its own or mix it with your moisturizer or foundation if you want.<br /><br />So this is a high quality product and worth every penny in my eyes. When you use it you will notice the strong essential oil scent and this is why I am torn. It is just a bi too almost medicinal to me. It is a scent that in my eyes should be in a massage parlor in the essential oil diffuser healing you of something. So for me it was just rather strong but thankfully it does not longer on your face too long.<br /><br />The oil is not too thick and absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It leaves a slight oily residue on your face and I don't fault it for that since it is an oil. However, if you give it about 10 minutes or so, that oily residue disappears and you feel just soft and smooth skin. Absolutely amazing in my eyes. I love how my face felt when I used that to be honest and was a bit shocked.<br /><br />So I love how it makes my face feel and look, I just need to get over the scent but since you really don't smell it on your face for long I think I can handle it.",5
"This is a very nice eye shadow palette. In it you get 2 cool brown shades that are mattes and one shimmer and one glitter shade. They are very nice colors and all go very well together so you really don't have to think hard to get a look that looks fantastic with this 4 color palette. The mattes blend easily and look great. Even a beginner should have no issue with these. I used them with and without a primer and they had fantastic staying power so no complaints there either.<br /><br />The shimmer and glitter were fantastic to make the look standout. Either one works for whatever occasion you have in mind, shimmer for day to day wear and glitter for a more evening wear in my eyes.<br /><br />At almost $30 for 4 colors this is a bit more on the expensive side since I have gotten some fantastic inexpensive palettes for less with a lot more colors but this is a very nice palette and great for travel really.",4
"I wasn't sure what to expect but I am a REAL fan of this deep emulsion. It comes in a cute little bottle that has a little pump dispenser on the top. The emulsion smells incredible and is one of my favorites really. It is super lightweight and feels very cooling when you use it so I really like to use this one when I saw a lot of sun during the day because it just feels fantastic and on top of that also smells great.<br /><br />The emulsion absorbs very quickly into your skin and your skin feels amazingly soft. I found my skin looked great as well so this one in my eyes really ticked all the boxes. I felt there was no residue left on my skin either. I for one am a fan and can only recommend this one and the price is not bad at all at less than $30. I might have to check into more of their products. Thankfully it came with lots of samples that I will try and probably end up getting more, oh the hardship.",5
"I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look. To me this is more a fail than anything else really.",2
"The Iryasa Face Cream comes in a little jar, which is not my favorite container since you obviously dip into it all the time. So I tend to wash my hands before I do that so I don't introduce dirt and such into it because that can shorten the life span of these products.<br /><br />The cream itself is actually a little heavy which was surprising since it looked light and airy. It has some nice natural ingredients in it which is great. I wasn't too crazy about the smell of it though but that is because it used Geranium essential oil, which is probably one of my least favorite but I was hoping that the lemon would help cover it but it still powered through a lot.<br /><br />The cream absorbs fairly quickly into your skin and but leaves a sticky residue on your skin that doesn't seem to fade for quite some time. Thankfully by using this at night you won't know since you add this last thing before you go to bed and then just fall asleep. It does add moisture to your skin so in the morning your skin does feel pretty nice.",4
"I really like this Tone Up Cream. It is a great little moisturizer that I like to use during the day a lot. It adds a nice little glow I find to my skin that just gives it a little extra. I don't like to wear foundation every day but instead like to wear tinted kind of products on occasion, just a little bit of something. This one is along those lines just a step back I think since it only adds a bit of glow really while giving a lot of moisture to your skin which it really needs right now. With wearing masks a lot my face is suffering and this really helps countering those effects.<br /><br />This moisturizer comes in a cute little squeeze tube that I do like. It smells very nice, a scent I can't pin point but is very lovely.",5
"This is a pretty nice face oil. It comes in a little dropper bottle that is pretty cute. I admit it smells like an essential oil and contains lavender, cypress and sweet orange, all scents I like.<br /><br />The oil is not very heavy and absorbs into your skin fairly quickly. It is a quite oily though and takes quite some time to absorb into your skin. But you can expect that from a face oil if you ask me. Unlike another oil from Lua this one stays oily though, not sure why that is. Because of the oil your face is soft though but that is mostly because of that greasiness. Probably after about an hour or two that goes away and your skin is nice and soft.",4
"This is a nice set of scrunchies. You get quite a variety of different scrunchies in this. You get some simple ring scrunchies I guess they call them that are my personal favorite, mostly because the colors are absolutely amazing in this trio. Then you get a trio of bunny ear style scrunchies that is also very cute and decorative and lastly a trio of scarf scrunchies that is very decorative as well.<br /><br />In addition you get 7 hair pins to dress up your hair that are very cute. I still have to learn how to use this the right way and make them work in my hair. I have finer hair so these tend to slide out but I know there is a trick to make them stay in place. This is definitely a cute set that is worth getting to dress up your hair.",5
"This is an pretty nice face sheet mask in my opinion. In the pack you get 4 masks for about $15, so almost $4 per mask, not the cheapest but also not the most expensive I have used to date.<br /><br />The masks are very easy to use. They come individually wrapped and are folded nicely. The material of these is not the softest I have used but they work. They smell REALLY nice however, a nice gentle floral with some other tones mixed in, very nice. You use these for about 15 to 20 minutes or so and gently rub the remainder of the mask into your skin.<br /><br />When I was done my skin felt pretty soft over. This mask is nice but it is not my favorite. My skin also had a nice residual scent left from the mask which I did enjoy. I would have expected a little better for the price since I have used cheaper masks that were nicer. All in all these are pretty nice though.",4
"Sadly I do not care for this True-Aloe cleansing bar. It is a fairly large soap bar I give it that, however I don't care for how it smells at all. The scent of this soap bar is actually sort of off putting to be honest, which is odd considering the ingredients that it has. Also it is kind of weird that it has these weird little bumbs in it, not sure what they are. My skin felt pretty dry when I used it as well so all in all I am not a fan of this.",2
"This kit is fantastic. It comes with everything you need to get your nails done with a gel manicure. It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails. Gel nail polish is actually pretty gentle to your nails and protecting at that plus it looks great.<br /><br />No complaints here, very happy with how long it took and the end results.",5
"I like this moisturizer from MD Complete. It comes in a very nice little pump dispenser that allows you to dispense the small quantities you need from this product.<br /><br />The product smells very nicely of citrus and is very lightweight. This moisturizer absorbs quickly into your skin and feels just fantastic. I really feel like it does a fantastic job in the department of moisturizing your skin. Your skin looks and feels fantastic when you use this product, well at least mine does. I have had no negative reactions when I use this moisturizer.<br /><br />It is reasonably priced and works well in my opinion. Personally I can recommend this.",4
"This Vitamin Brightening Ampoule by BE PLAIN is just ok in my eyes. It is pretty much scentless so that is boring but it does come in a beautiful frosted little dropper bottle. The serum is however just ok.<br /><br />The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. The downside with it however is it leaves your skin tacky and that feeling fades but never really fully goes away. There is always a bit of that tacky residue on your skin. I did not notice any significant brightening effects either so it did not come through on that promise either.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok to be honest. I didn't really like how my face felt and it didn't really brighten it either. It does have some ingredients that are good for my face so at least it does some good things for my face even if I don't necessarily like how it feels when it is on, but you can always put another moisturizer on.",3
"This is a nice, inexpensive conditioner for your eyelashes and eyebrows. It is very gentle and you can comfortable use it around the eyes. I have had no negative reactions not even teary eyes at any time. This product is very easy to use which is good. So far I noticed a mild increase in regards to eye lashes and my eye brows do look a little fuller. Considering the price point of this product I think it is worth the investment to see if it works for you as well.",5
"In this set you get a keratin shampoo and keratin conditioner. Both of them are sulfate free which is great, however when I read the ingredients it turns out that the shampoo actually has silicone in it, not a fan of that. Thankfully the conditioner does not seem to have any in it.<br /><br />So the shampoo is not bad. The scent is decent, nothing spectacular though just ok in my eyes. It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set. All in all this gets a 3 star for me since the conditioner is pretty good, the shampoo is just below average in my eyes. As a set it may be just a tad overpriced though.",3
"This shampoo is just middle of the road for me. It comes in a bottle that has a little dispense opening on the top, personally I prefer pump dispensers that just make things a lot easier. The bottle itself is actually a bit small, thought it would be bigger especially for the $20 price tag.<br /><br />The smell of it was not bad but also not great. It produced a nice light lather that did a good job cleaning my hair I would say. It didn't feel like it was drying out my hair or anything. I can't say that I noticed any significant improvement on the appearance of my hair in regards of anti thinning. To me it was just a regular shampoo to be honest and for that it was overpriced and the scent not up to par.",3

"I am sad to say this eye shadow palette just isn't for me. The colors themselves would actually be pretty nice overall, but they disappoint in their application.<br /><br />So first of there are no mattes, so you can only use this for accents when using other eye shadow palettes really to use the shimmers nad glitters in this one. the colors are not bad, except they are not very pigmented at all and you really don't get very good payoff when you use them. And then of course there is the white one with the chunky sequins in it, you should not under any circumstances use this on your eyes, that is just plain dangerous! Use it on your cheeks, your body but not on your eyes, that is just not safe at all!<br /><br />They claim that with this palette you can complete a perfect eye shadow makeup, well no, you can not. There is no matte and no transition shade. There is just no way you can create a look from this palette. Plus I actually tried, they do not blend at all.",1
"Beware, this is a product that is meant for nails with toe fungus and to completely remove those nails and start fresh!<br /><br />They make it sound like it is to strengthen nails that may need some help but once you read the instructions on the box it actually tells you when you use this product that your nail will fall off.<br /><br />It smells pretty horrific. So unless you have severe nail fungus and want your nails to fall off, don't use this. I haven't tried it since that is not what I wanted. When I got this I read the ""renews, restores and dehydrates damaged nails, repairs and protects"" not makes your nails fall of. So with that being said, I will have to pass actually using this product.",1
"This is a very nice sheet face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.",5
"This is an interesting serum for your face. The bottle comes in this interesting dropper bottle that only shows the dropper when you unscrew the cap. The serum is a milky kind of solution, so make sure you mix it well before you use it just to make sure it is well mixed.<br /><br />The serum is kind of thick but absorbs quickly into your skin. Your skin stays tacky for about an hour or so. After that it becomes fairly nice and soft.<br /><br />The serum does have a scent to it but I can't describe it. It is fairly nice though so no complaints there. I have had no negative skin reactions or issues when I used this product. This to me is a little over average.",4
"These are nice under eye patch masks. They have a nice mild citrus type of scent, almost like mango so not sure how they can say they are unscented because they are not. I personally really like the scent so that is a plus in my eyes. Also surprised how some reviewers say they are unscented. So confusing.<br /><br />These come with a small pair of plastic tweezers to help you get the little patches out. The patches come in a cute little jar. The patches are thicker, gel like and very nice. I had an issue with them staying in place though. You keep them on for about 10 to 15 minutes or so. By that time they are almost dry so all the active ingredients are mostly in your skin or on by the time you are done. The rest you just let absorb when you remove the patches.<br /><br />The patches are nice and cooling and I really like how they feel on. I just wish they wouldn't slip since they did slip on me a bit. Not a big deal just a little annoyance.",4
"This hair finishing stick works quite well. It comes in a similar tube as your eye mascara does and also has a similar wand to it. The gel is clear and very lightweight. It feels almost like water when you have it on your hair really. It is not sticky or greasy really.<br /><br />I was surprised that it works quite well and the staying power is pretty good as well. It is fairly cheap to so not a big investment there and definitely reasonable. I am not sure how big of an issue it really is though to get something like it. I guess if you are going to a big event and you want everything to be just perfect this is a product for it, but on a day to day basis I wouldn't really bother with it. But it works and it is pretty much scentless, so no issues there at all.",5
"I have pretty long hair and most people with long hair know the issue with split ends. The last time I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are blue but with a tie dye kind of effect in them, super cute. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $10 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten.",5
"This is an ok face day lotion. It comes in a beautiful pump dispenser however which I personally prefer. It does have some nice ingredients like shea butter and hyaluronic acid.<br /><br />Where it lacks is its scent. It doesn't have a scent that is worth writing home about. I didn't care for it at all and thankfully it doesn't linger on your skin either.<br /><br />When you use this moisturizer it is pretty light but is sticky on your skin when you use it. It does absorb fairly quickly though. My skin just felt ok when I used this. It didn't feel super soft or anything nor did it look anything spectacular. This to me was just a middle of the road kind of moisturizer. Now considering all this and the cost of $63, I just can't recommend this product. I think it is overpriced and for what you get I am just not a fan at all.",2
"In today's age when you are restricted with how much liquids you can bring along on your travels on an airplane, it makes sense to fill these little refillable atomizer bottles with your favorite perfume to bring along so you can have them in your carry on luggage. Some times you don't even have a checked in luggage so this is important.<br /><br />I like that in this pack you get 5 different ones. You can dedicate each one to a different perfume so you can bring different ones on your travel. These work very well and you can bring enough on your travels for at least a week plus. They are easy to fill and use and work very well. These are on the cheaper side but for what they are intended these work perfectly well.",4
"You get a lot of hyaluronic acid serum in this bottle. It is pretty much scent less for those who prefer that this one is perfect in that regards. There were no hints of thyme, so not sure if it should smell of it since it is in their name? It feels very tacky on your skin when you apply it and stays that way for a few minutes. So it does take a few minutes to fully absorb into your skin. Your skin feels pretty soft after that, not the softest I have experienced but not bad overall.<br /><br />They recommend to rub it in until it is absorbed, that is a bit tough since it is so sticky. All in all not a bad product but definitely not my favorite.<br /><br />Someone did make a good point about this coming in a plastic bottle. I ended up looking it up and it does have a fairly low pH. That does make me wonder what it does to that plastic bottle and if over time it will dissolve that plastic bottle.",3
"These reusable makeup remover pads environmentally friendly since you can wash them and reuse them which I prefer, which is awesome. Plus they are just so much nicer on your skin. It comes with 16 bamboo/cotton pads and 5x bamboo/cotton/charcoal pads. These are super soft and for sensitive areas. You also get a little mesh pouch where you can store these pads in and also wash them in the washer. This way you won't loose them. It seems they really thought of everything you could possible need! I have been looking for something like these for some time and this is the perfect set. I wish they would have just made all in darker colors so they don't show the makeup stains at all but it is ok the way it is and I can work with it. Fantastic buy of a high quality product!",5
"This is a gentle facial cleanser that works very well. It doesn't have a pleasant scent I enjoy but it is not horrible. My skin did feel a bit dry after I used this though and I would have wished it would be more hydrating as they promised. I had to follow it up with a nice moisturizer to make sure my skin didn't dry out too much when I use this cleanser. In my eyes this cleanser is just ok. I was a bit disappointed by the entire line to be honest. It is a bit on the more expensive side with all their products being at least $34 and up. Some of them are on the even more expensive side in my eyes for what you get. They do tend to fall short on the fragrance side across the board.<br /><br />This line is just not for me and did not perform well for me overall. This cleanser did not hydrate but it did cleanse well and was gentle, so at least it performed along those lines. So for that I gave it a 3 star rating.",3
"This is a very nice mascara. It does come however in a cheaper looking container I think, at least to me the cartoonish container looks cheaper. I didn't think it really added that much volume to my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18. I have some others that perform similarly that are cheaper than this one though so it is a bit overpriced in my eyes.",4
"This is a fantastic little gift set. It contains a moisturizing cream and an overnight night mask that both come in beautiful little jars.<br /><br />These smell lovely of rose water. They contain some great ingredients like squalene, retinol, Aloe Vera, shea butter, chamomile, hyaluronic acid, argan oil, collagen and more. This is really a little power house.<br /><br />Both are on the lighter side and absorb quickly into your skin. Your skin looks and feels great when you use these. I really this and this makes for a great gift. The price is also fantastic.",4
"This is a very nice hand care bundle for very hands on people. First you get a very nice hand cleaner that contains activated charcoal. This detoxes and cleans very nicely of the toughest dirt, eliminating strong odor but doesn't damage your hands like some strong cleaners might do.<br /><br />Next you get a moisturizing and healing cream. This is great for those who have done some damage to their hands in some physical hand jobs where they hand up with dry and cracked hands. This gives back some moisture and heals those hands.<br /><br />Last but not least is a nice protect and moisturizer. This adds a nice barrier to your hands but also adds much needed hydration to much abused hands that are dry, cracked and scaly. When you have this on your hands it is much easy to wash and wipe away stubborn dirt.<br /><br />This is a nice little set that can also be gifted, especially for people who work with their hands like mechanics or wood workers but many others. This works really well and will help restore some of those much abused hands.",4
"I really wanted to like this but I am just not a fan. It has a very strong menthol scent to it that I just am not big on. I am very sensitive to menthol smells and can't stand it. This one is very strong and overpowering.<br /><br />It does have a refreshing feel to it but the smell of menthol just overpowers everything. My skin was soft when I used it and did not dry out so that is great. So for those who like menthol this is great, but for me this just doesn't work.",3
"These are very nice hair clips. I am impressed on how strong these are. In this pack you get 4 clips for each of the 3 colors, clear, brown and black. I have long hair but on the thinner side and these clips had no issue holding my hair together. I think the key is the design and how they made the teeth.<br /><br />These hair clips are very well made and look great. I am impressed on how good these really are and really like using these.",5
"This is a very nice face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face and let sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses. It feeds your skin it feels like with the serum it contains and leaves your skin soft and healthy. Your face will look and feel great. This is a nice little treat for yourself. You will get 10 masks in this pack which is actually a really nice deal.",5
"I did not know what to expect with this facial cleansing milk. It comes in this nice bottle. When you dispense it onto your hand you will notice it is a lotion like cleanser. It smells beautifully and is one of my favorite cleansers actually. It is super gentle and really cleanses your face nicely. There is nothing bad about this product really, it smells fantastic, is gentle and does a very nice job cleansing your face. This is a winner all around and my usual go to product.",5
"This is now the third product from Taya I have tried out, and I have to say this line does not dissappoint. This is probably the most fancy dispenser I have had to date and the most fancy looking bottle. The shampoo is this super creamy, beautiful creamy shampoo. It does not produce a massive lather but to cleanse your hair that is not necessary. You will also notice the incredible smell it has. The conditioner smells the same. I have a body spray that it reminds me off and it is just incredible.<br /><br />This set is a bit on the more expensive side but my hair does look, feel and smell amazing when I use it, so I use this on my splurge and pamper days. They do make some claims for anti breakage and some ingredients that supposedly help with that. I can't really confirm those claims but I do really like this set a lot. It also comes in this unique bottle with an interesting dispensing mechanism and unlike some I had no issues with it whatsoever.",5
"This hydrating cream by Sustainable Youth is one of their better products in my eyes. It is a pretty heavy cream but it does absorb fairly quickly and fully into your skin. It smells heavily of citrus, so finally one of their products actually smells good. Most of their products I have tried to date either don't have a scent or smell kind of bad. Considering how expensive they are in general that is just not acceptable in my eyes. Thankfully this one actually smells pretty good since it is also pretty expensive.<br /><br />This heavier cream actually leaves behind very soft skin that looks good. I liked how my skin felt. The scent of it does dissipate fairly quickly though but that is ok. All in all this is probably my favorite product in their line. Would I repurchase, probably not because their are products out there as good and better for a similar price or cheaper. But from this line this is their best product in my opinion.",5
"This is a very cute makeup bag. The coloring of it is just gorgeous and the main reason I got it really. The material is super soft. It comes with a hand strap that allows you to quickly grab it. On the inside it has a mash pocket on the side that allows you to keep smaller items secured. It is a pretty decent size that allows you to bring all your makeup on your travels.<br /><br />It came with some beauty blenders that are pretty good. The makeup brushes that came with it however are just plain cheap and in my opinion crap. You can make them work but I personally don't care for them and have better ones, so there is just no time I will really use them. Plus the weird handle they have really doesn't make them very user friendly either. These are just a waste in my eyes and not sure why they even bothered with them.<br /><br />The bag itself however is gorgeous and a win. I actually had a tough time deciding which color to get because they are all so cute!",5
"This is a nice makeup holder with some ""bling"". Apparently I have accumulated too many products over the last few months and was in need of additional storage. This one is similar to another one I have. Just like with other ones with a lazy Susan the shelves are adjustable which is great since you have products of different size. On the top it has different sections so you can put some items like small bottles, eye liners, brushes, mascara and so on in there to keep those organized as well, which my other two lazy Susan organizers do not have, so this is kind of neat in my eyes. All my organizers are just a tad different so I keep them for different purposes, this one is great for lotions, dropper bottles and mascaras and such. It is very sturdy and a great addition to keep my things organized.",5
"This set of lip balm is very nice. It applies easily and leaves your lips feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy or tacky. They taste of tangerine which is great. I admit, for lip balms I want one that has a good flavor at this point and this one delivers 100%. It is packed with great for your lips ingredients such as hemp seed oil, Vitamin E and olive oil and no, it does not taste like olive oil. It is cruelty free which is another bonus in my eyes.<br /><br />It was a bit tricky to open though but once you get it it is actually a neat design, instead of twisting it on the bottom you twist it right by the bottom of the cap.",5
"This is the third product I have tried by Merlot and I also like this one, so 2 out of 3 is not bad. This serum is packed with peptides, resveratrol and grape seed extract.<br /><br />You don't need a lot of this and what you apply quickly absorbs into your skin. It smells great and smells of grapes, which is actually a rare scent in beauty products and nice for a change. My skin felt and looked great when I used this serum. The price is also very reasonable so I for one can recommend this. I am also a fan of the pump dispenser, it is clean and easy to work with and keeps the rest of the product clean as well.",5
"Now this is a body lotion I can only recommend. It is in very classy blue bottle and packed with some very good ingredients like almond oil, Vitamin C, E and K, and Kale, and you will feel that.<br /><br />First when you use it, you will notice this heavenly smell of coconut! I love coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 100% in favor of it. But it gets better. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with super soft, beautiful looking skin that smells of coconut. You don't need a lot of this lotion and it quickly and fully absorbs into your skin.<br /><br />This for me is a perfect body lotion.",5
"Now this is quite the mascara. First of it comes in this beautiful container, full of bling, so this is for the girly girl of girls. I have to say I was a bit oh my when I saw that since I am not your girly girl. BUT when I used this I was rather impressed. I didn't think it really thickened my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. I didn't apply a ton since I used it during the day and not for a night out in town. It added a good amount of length to be honest and it didn't look fake, it was a ""wet eyelashes"" kind of look that I really liked. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is waterproof and definitely smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this and can only recommend this.",5
"This lip balm is just ok in my eyes. It does work and softens your lips. I do like the fact that it has sun protection in it since melanoma is a serious problem in today's age. I would have hoped that with the ingredients of coconut and grape seed that it would have had a flavor of either one in it, but sadly it does not. It was fairly tasteless actually. Nowadays a lot of lip balms are flavored and to be honest that is one of the criteria why I pick certain lip balms.<br /><br />Yes this one works and its staying power is pretty good. It gets points for its sun blocking powers but I am deducting one for the lack of flavor, especially since I used other products from this line that definitely had the flavor/scent of grapes.",4
"This is a very nice eye shadow palette. It comes with a total of 12 eye shadows, including 8 mattes with warm and cold tone browns and 4 shimmers, 2 warm and 2 cold tones there. I like that this palette allows you to cold or warm tone.<br /><br />The eye shadows are highly pigmented and are beautiful brown shades. Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner. Plus I also like using lighter colors for the eye lid so I wished the shimmers were a bit lighter, or at least had one lighter one in the mix.<br /><br />This is a beautiful set with very nice mattes and shimmers that blend nicely and give you gorgeous looks for any occasion.",5
This is a fantastic wig! I love the length on this and how the hair curls in on the front. The hair is just plain beautiful. The red color is a beautiful burgundy color which I am a huge fan of. This a great find for anyone looking for a great wig! The hair is nice and soft and just falls like a beautiful little waterfall in the front. I love how it frames my face when I wear this. The ombre effect on it is done to perfection! Fantastic find.,5
"These are some nice pairs of false reusable eyelashes. They are easy to use and look great. You get 4 pairs and some tweezers to help applying them. They are made out of faux mink. I like how they make my eyes look and give my eye lashes a nice full look, great for a night out in town. These are comfortable to wear all night long since they are fairly light. I would definitely recommend them for evening use and not for day time use since they have a bit of a dramatic flare to them.",4
"This colored hair wax works very well. It is perfect for those Halloween or cosplay occasions. If I would have gotten a different color than gray I guess I could have used it on other occasions for like accent strikes of hairs.<br /><br />It is easy to use and leaves a similar feeling behind as if you used some of those colored hair sprays. The hair is a tad stiff, just like it is when you use hair wax. I don't use those kinds of products often so it is always a bit weird to me when I can't just run my fingers through my long hair.<br /><br />It washes out easily without any problems. When you apply it and wash your hands it comes of easy as well. This is a very easy to use product without any issues and not very expensive so you can't really go wrong with it.",4
"This facial cream comes in a cute little pump dispenser.It is a gentle cream that has a pleasant scent to it that only lingers for a short little time. It quickly absorbs into your skin and leaves a beautiful looking skin behind that is very soft.<br /><br />My skin had no negative reactions to it, no reddening, no rashes, nothing. My skin felt nice and moisturized when using this. I don't really have a lot of dark spots so it is tough to tell if those are lightened when using this cream.",4
"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. It almost felt like a lotion when I used it. So the description that it does NOT lather is 100% accurate. I was a bit confused by that to be honest so yes read the description. It works very well that is true. It was almost completely without scent, it may have had some very mild scent but I couldn't describe what it smelled like.<br /><br />To me it was weird to wash your face with something that felt more like a lotion than anything else. So this only gets an ok since it wasn't outstanding in any category really. I had no negative reactions to it and it is super gentle but that is about it.",3
"These wooden brushes are just plain fantastic. The bristles are nice and stiff but not too stiff to hurt you. Stiff enough however to stimulate to provide a good scrub, wet or dry for that matter. You get 2 brushes in this set and one handle that you can put on either brush.<br />One is a nice round brush with nylon bristles that are good for scrubbing your feet that cleanses, softens and smooths the skin. The second brush is an oval brush that just has the stiff boar bristles that helps to exfoliate and smooths the skin.<br /><br />Using these brushes dry helps cleanse your skin but also stimulates your lymphatic system. It promotes blood circulation, helps excrete toxins and relaxes your muscles. Plus it just feels great! You can switch the handle between these two brushes for the one you need it for which is convenient in my eyes. I really like using these and they are just good for you and feel fantastic.",5
"This serum contains Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Argireline Peptides, Vitamin E,  Red Marine Algine and some others, all ingredients that are good for your skin and are similar to their face moisturizer. The consistency of the serum is however different and you need a lot less of this product I found. A tiny bit goes a long way!<br /><br />This product comes in cute little pump dispenser that works very well. After I used this product I didn't think my skin felt super soft like it felt after using some other serums in comparison, it felt ok no doubt but not like with some other serums so that was a bit disappointing. I also found this product did not smell very good, similar to their moisturizer. I am not sure what it is about this line. Thankfully that scent does not linger for long.<br /><br />This product is definitely not for me, and I think this line at this point may  not be for me all together since I am striking out at 2 for 2.",3
"This face moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C, plus some other good ingredients is not bad. It also contains glycolic acid, salicyclic acid, Vitamin A and E and really has a lot of good ingredients for your skin. It is lightweight and applies nicely to your skin. This moisturizer absorbs very quickly but your skin doesn't feel super soft after you apply it. Yes it is soft but I have other moisturizer that make my skin feel a lot softer when I use them.<br /><br />It comes in this really cute pump dispenser that is very stylish. What I did not like about this moisturizer is the scent of it. I can't pinpoint what it smells like but I did not particularly care for it. Thankfully the scent does not linger very long on your skin. The other thing I did not understand that in the directions of using it it says "" follow with moisturizer or makeup"". Why would I have to use a moisturizer after using this moisturizer? Pretty confusing if you ask me.<br /><br />All in all this product is just ok in my book. It felt ok on my skin, smelt bad to me at least and the instructions were weird to say the least. For this price you can get some other products that work better and definitely smell better!",3
"This is a decent makeup brush set. Would I pay $40 for this, NEVER. First the bag is very nice. The 4 brushes that come with it are also very nice, but are they basically worth $10 a brush, no. For that kind of money you are better of buying a Sigma brush. I was also supposed to get a makeup brush cleaner in this, but that was missing.<br /><br />In this set you get a powder brush that was nice and fluffy and worked well. You also get a foundation brush that was also very nice. The flat cream concealer brush worked well and you also get a concealer detail brush that again worked really well. None of these are outstanding and any better than you can find in the beginner sets you can get for like $10 to $20 depending on the set size. So getting the bag and supposed brush cleaner that I did not get does not warrent the $40 in my eyes.",2
This is a nice little concealer. I used it on some scars as well as skin blemishes and it worked alright for the most part. It was true to skin color. It covered the skin blemishes beautifully but not the scars. I had no issues blending it as long as you blend it right away and it look good after you were done. I would not use it as an eye shadow primer however because of its properties.,3
"This pen basically is used to ""fill in"" larger pores with one end and the other end (black felt tip of sorts) helps smoothen it all out. The ""pink"" end is their primer that basically fills in whatever you want to cover up.<br /><br />This ""primer"" has no scent to it and is very soft and almost melts into your skin.  It has about light to medium coverage.",3
"I really like this lip scrub. It tastes deliciously of peach and is nice and gentle. Let's face it you don't want something that is too harsh on your lips and scrub the heck out of them. You want something nice and smooth that gently scrubs away the excess skin that is oh so annoying and tempts you into biting it off.<br /><br />This scrub has Vitamin E, jojoba and coconut oil and some other nice ingredients and as I said tastes deliciously of peach. I personally am a huge fan of peach and this tastes 100% of peach and doesn't have a weird artificial flavor which is great. Thanks to the oils in this scrub your lips feel great after your wipe of the scrub.",5
"This is a very nice, well made scrunchie, but what I do not understand is, why one scrunchie is $17? I have gotten a 52 pack for $8 before and they are all very nice scrunchies. Yes I understand that the silk does not damage the hair and therefore doesn't cause split ends, but at this price it better blow dry my hair for me while I am still sleeping.<br /><br />It is beautiful, the color is a very nice deep emerald green, it is very well made, the silk has no pulled threads or anything, but I don't think I would be willing to spend that kind of money on just one. If this was a 5 pack or so I would be ok with it even for silk.",3
My wife loves this. Hoping to get another one soon.....,5
"As a licensed professional I do not recommend this product. My spa owner purchased this from Amazon, when I went to try it on a PAYING CLIENT,  the glue did absolutely nothing. If the glue doesn't work then the service cannot proceed. I have done this service on many clients with a different brand and had success. This product not at all.",1
Not hand friendly but get the job done,2
Absolutely my FAVORITE!,5
It has a bad taste,2
I am willing to pay a few dollars extra for these razors. I've bought cheaper razors but they cut me and get dull and get rusty very fast. The Dorco brand has protective barriers on the razor so you won't cut yourself.  They work for a long time and do not rust!  My first set last 4 years before I had to replace them.  I recommend only buying DORCO.,5
"Defective product. The strap was too small for my head but replacing it is not possible without ripping the hair out. The attachment on one side was in the hair on the front instead of the back of the head. So it would not work even if the stap did fit unless you folded it.  In addition, some of the hair was already falling out. I added a picture of the side which was not defective. I have it two stars but the color matched my hair exactly.",2
i bought for structure gel and builder gel.  I am happy with the brushes.,5
"I’m pleasantly surprised, it’s a nice headband wig. I thought it was going to look like plastic, but it doesn’t it’s a nice texture. This is great for the price! Throw on an go!",5
I'm very happy with this product! Beautiful design and high quality results,5
Useless. To small to use for pin curls.,1
Love this matt lip color!,5
"Great customer service, and super cool diffuser!",5
"I used it in 5 different parts of my body, and hair grew back immediately on my legs (the most noticeable body part), even after multiple uses weekly.  I followed the instructions exactly, and did not receive the results I wanted.  Overall,  with the price I paid and how it didn't work, I would not recommend this to others.",3
This plant mister is perfect. I bought it it use on my air plants. It sprays a very fine mist and my plants are doing great!,5
"I love a peppermint scent, and I love when there are those oils to make your skin feel refreshed.  I thought that might be the case on your scalp with this shampoo, but it didn't.  I like the mix of peppermint and lavendar, and I think it worked just fine.  Overall, it works as well as any other shampoo.",4
"I've recently started doing my own ""dip powder"" nails, which lasts SO much longer than gel.  Plus, I don't have to worry about getting a fungus from the salon.  They can be pretty tough to take off, so you HAVE TO have Acetone to get them off.  I can use this stuff on a little cotton ball, wrap my nail and cotton in tinfoil, and let them soak for a bit.  This does the trick and quickly brings the polish/powder off.  In short, it does what it's supposed to do.",5
"These are impossible to use! Once each eyelash is connected to the applicator, then they won't connect to each other because the magnetic in the applicator is stronger! And forget trying to manually apply. Picture trying to balance one eyelash on your eyelashes while attaching another from the bottom! The top eyelash will jump off to connect to the other one before you can even get it close! Don't waste your money.",1
I had this item sitting in my cart for a long time. I finally placed my order because the kit would basically pay for itself after one use. I was very impressed with everything. The colors are beautiful and last. Will definitely be ordering more colors! So happy with my purchase and my only regret is not buying it sooner!,5
So good...and I'm picky.,5
So Cheap! They Melt & Snap Apart as Soon as The Body Heat From Your Scalp Touches It!,1
"I highly recommend getting a bears straightener and this one in particular.<br />If you have never used one, they work miracles. My beard hair is curly and seems to have a mind of its own. After using this the hair is much straiter and easier to style and manage. It also helps my beard to appear thicker and fuller.<br />The device is extremely well built and comes with many accessories for your beard needs.",5
"Works great. Strong hold, odor isn't my favorite. Only need to use a little to go a long way.",5
This is probably the worst fiber lash mascara I have ever used! It just clumped all my eyelashes together! I just looked like I have clumps for eyelashes! Not good at all!,1
This product is AMAZING!!! It is so much healthier for your nails than dip and so much easier to file down. It does take a little getting used to but overall amazing!!!,5
I absolutely love the colors in this set! This is a perfect holiday color palette and I will definitely use this for Christmas! I also love that it come with a brush for excess powder. This is a very convenient color kit.,5
"I do find these hair clips quite sturdy!  I have been using them to hold a pony tail. But not as strong to hold a ponytail on securely.  The teeth are very small,  and there is no grip of the hair.  The clip will fall.<br /><br />Many years ago,  I had a ton of hair and now,  sadly,  it has thinned out.  I now can use hair clips to hold the entire hair.  I like that the clips look simple,  they are not bulky and fit easily on my hair.  I usually use one  and/or two on the pony tail.  I can wear this clip on my hair in public and it is not very visible.  I am getting a lot of use right now.  I like the clips!  The Clips will hold a ponytail,  but eventually will slide.  Just use it for holding the hair back in place.",5
"This Norelco shaving system is just that, a system!  That's what one pays for because the closeness of the razor is not near what the hand held manual razor can do.  We have used this, face for hubby, legs for me, and bottom line is the shave is not as close.<br /><br />There are great perks here!  The multi-purpose display is excellent, indicates how much time you have left before recharging and the time is plenty!  The storage case and charging stand are neat features.  But for the quick shave, you need to use it too long, going over and over!  It sure looks good though!  ...Rizzo",3
"Husband grew a beard the moment he was put on blood thinners, and he has it trimmed once a month, but sometimes that's not enough. When it gets too long he tends to look like Grizzly Adams. I would keep it tamed with scissor trims, but this works much better; he can do the trim himself, and also trim his cheeks and mustache. We haven't tried it on trimming the hair at the back of his neck.<br /><br />He does not like that it is only USB and you have to buy a wall plug adapter to charge it. I guess they figure most people have them now, but it should come with one. That's just being cheap.",4
They aren't your typical shower caps. I thought I was getting a deal but they are so cheap I can barely use them twice. They are sealed together on either side so if you don't open them carefully you can rip them. They also don't stretch very much so it's not for long hair.<br />Don't waste your money.,1
I hate this stuff. It is like clown makeup. Only Cole cream will take it off. It will clog your pores and make you break out. Only use if you really need full coverage. It would be better to head to ultra and just get a shade darker than you normally use for powder. Just avoid powders with Zinc….zinc turns white in stage lighting.,2
"So cute! My 7 year old has loved playing with them. And best of all, they wash right out!! Love it!",5
They are so heavy and gorgeous that I hate to give them such a low review. The ornate heads are beautiful. They are so sturdy and are a great length for a low bun. However. The textured design that comes from the head and down the stick on some of them rip at my hair making it difficult to get them in and out of a tight bun.,3
"I was skeptical because of the price and I've always used Neutrogena wipes and they have always worked great. But these were so much cheaper with good reviews that I thought I would give them a try and I love them! They take the makeup off (eyeliner, mascara, foundation, lipstick - all of it) and leaves my face feeling softer and more moisturized than any other wipes I've used.",5
Works excellent a lot of power only downside is the base not heavy enough what's the tip over as the water gets lower I still give it 5 stars for effectiveness,5
I love ordering my hair from Amazon and this was great hair!,5
"This has worked pretty well for me over the past couple weeks of use, but I can’t say it’s worked better than products that cost half the price. It’s a good moisturizer, but it’s overpriced.",4
"Though a bit pricey at $20 for 3.4 ounces, this face scrub does deliver solid results. It smells great, very fresh and masculine. It thoroughly exfoliates my skin and leaves it feeling soft, clean, smooth and moisturized. I've found that it's great to use before shaving, as it preps the skin by smoothing and moisturizing it.",4
"Never heard of this brand but it was definitely the packaging that caught my attention. The saying ""never judge a book by its cover"" does NOT apply in this CASE. PLEASE try out this mascara. My lashes looked significantly longer and thicker with out any flakes or clumps. A very long lasting mascara  for a relatively decent price. Also, considering how long lasting it wore, the removal was insanely easy. I love this mascara!",5
"This is a very decent palette for the price. I like the shades offered, and they are of good quality.",4
"This is a very unique and effective product.<br /><br />Used with a light pre-styler on medium-length hair:<br /><br />Scent: It's a light scent. Warm and slightly spiced. Very pleasant and masculine.<br />Consistency: Extremely creamy. Becomes slightly tacky when emulsifying.<br />Styling: Smooth through the hair at first, with increasing tug the more you style. This is not a problem for me and is part of getting great hold from a product.<br />Finish: Slightly shiny at first, but becomes much more matte as it dries in the hair.<br />Hold: Legitimate all-day hold without becoming too rigid to restyle.<br /><br />This is one of my new favorites. Seriously good in all areas, which is so rare. TheSalonGuy has a real winner with this one.",5
"I really like this moisturizer. The consistency is extremely soft and smooth, and it feels incredible on my skin. It moisturizes wonderfully and feels like it actually fortifies the skin, making it feel thicker and stronger. The scent is very fresh and it absorbs well. I am already noticing (after a few days) a slight lightening of the skin under my eyes, which is exciting. A bit pricey, but definitely high quality.",4
These bottles are very good quality. All in perfect working order. They’re a great buy for the price.,5
"Pricey, but it’s a high quality scrub. Great texture and exfoliation.",4
"Aside from being a tad overpriced for a daily face wash, this stuff is great. It smells like cucumber - clean and fresh, it has the consistency of aloe vera gel but a bit thicker. The lather is low-foam. It feels great on my skin, and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. Definitely a high quality product.",4
"Applying to medium length hair with a light prestyler.<br /><br />Scent: Very spicy. Christmas spices.<br />Texture: Waxy clay. Very thick.<br />Application: Thick and a bit tough to emulsify in the hands. A bit sticky during application.<br />Styling: Pretty responsive, but you have to work quickly.<br />Finish: Very high hold. Fairly low shine, but not matte.",3
"This is a great product. The hold is strong, the finish is truly matte, and the price is a lot better than comparable clays, waxes and fibers. It has a light, masculine scent.",5
"This is definitely a ""cooling"" body wash. It makes my skin tingle and would be excellent in the summer months when you need to bring your body temperature down. The scent is like menthol-eucalyptus, but a bit sweeter. The lather is very thick and smooth, and it rinses away leaving my skin feeling cool and moisturized. The only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. $15 is a bit much for 6 ounces of product.",4
"I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.",4
"This shampoo smells great. The scent is very natural, but unfortunately it's not. Rather than using the pricier essential oils of peppermint and lavender, the company uses synthesized fragrance. The lather is decent and washes your hair about as well as any bargain-priced brand from the supermarket shelf. I did notice that it leaves my hair feeling a bit flat. There is no reason for the high price aside from name familiarity, as this brand is used by some hotel chains.",3
"I really like the consistency of this face wash. It's like wet clay, with a gentle and pleasant scent. It has just the right amount of lather and it spreads very easily over my face. The only drawback is that is will dry your face out. I suppose this can be countered with a basic facial moisturizer.",4
"This body wash is excellent. The scent is delicious, like real orange, the lather is thick with small bubbles, and it noticeably moisturizes your skin. The only drawback is the price. It's currently listed for $10 for 4 ounces, which is basically travel size.",4
"I wasn't expecting my mirror to get a cleaning also! I was excited to finally have a water pick so when I received my package I immediately set it up and studied the directions. Once I was confident, I began and as soon as i turn it on, water went everywhere! It all ricochet ed all oclver my bathroom counter and mirror. Safe to say that you literally need to use this in the shower. But besides that, it has many attachments, different speeds and does a great job!",4
This is my own personal experience with this lash growth enhancer and my own opinion. I did not notice any difference in my lashes since I started using it a month ago. I've documented my experience with pictures every 3 days. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because I've seen that it's worked for others but I guess it isn't compatible with my biology. I'm  bit disappointed.,2
One liter almost lasted a year.... I forgot how much I spent but it's worth it,5
"This was a new thing for me to try.  I liked it but find myself not using it.  I thought maybe my wife would like it but it seems that she is not using it either.  It seems to take more soap than just using a washcloth.  I do like how it feels when I use it.  It feels nice on my body.  I won't give up yet, I will keep trying it.",4
I ordered these as replacements. They arrived on time and were just what I needed. They were affordable and practical. Definitely worth purchasing.,5
"Besame classic lipstick (Forever Red 1925) is creamy, moisturizing and conditioning. The color is a bright red, which gives you just the right amount of pop, especially if you are wearing a solid color (like black, blue or grey). I wish it was a deeper red, but regardless I will make it work. It makes my lips feel soft and smooth. It isn’t drying at all. It doesn’t bead on your lips. I wouldn’t consider this a matte finish, but it isn’t really shiny either. It has decent staying power (you can eat or drink while wearing it). Overall, this is a terrific lipstick to put in my rotation. I’d recommend it.",4
"I like that this set (Fragrantshare) contains a variety of (make-up) brushes. You get 18 brushes in different shapes and sizes. You get everything from a foundation brush, to one that you can apply eyeshadow with. They (black) handles are easy to hold and use. The bristles are made of animal hair.  So, far I haven’t noticed any shedding. Everyone knows that you should change out your brushes every once in a while. So, give these a chance. Did I mention, this set is inexpensive, under $21 on Amazon.",4
"The Ikoo Infusions hair mask was surprisingly great. It is moisturizing, hydrating and nourishing. This product comes in a round (6.8 oz) container. The thick (light green) cream smells refreshing and bright.  Some of the ingredients are macadamia oil, honey extract and camellia oil. It is non-greasy but does leave a slight shine. This product is cruelty, vegan, sulfate and paraffin free (Peta approved since that is important for some consumers). I have coarse, sometimes dry hair, that after using this product made it more manageable after just one treatment. I used it as a deep conditioning treatment. It left my scalp and hair feeling refreshed and clean. I’d recommend it.",4
"Clearly Amazon has mis-priced this brush. $50, for a plastic handled brush and firm bristles? First, I am ok with the plastic handle. It is easy to grip and hold. And since it is plastic, you don’t have to worry about it looking faded after several washes (I do clean mine) like you do with the wooden ones. I’m even ok with the firm bristles (nylon and boar), because I have coarse hair and I’m not tender headed.  I like that it smooths the hair easily.  What I don’t like is the PRICE. I can’t believe they expect people to pay $49 for this brush. Yikes! And the sad thing is that it didn’t even come in pretty packaging. Just in a simple white box. So, while I am sure I will use this brush, I can’t get over the price. 2 stars",2
"LaClaire (Beverly Hills) Clarifying Cleanser is a delight on the skin. Simply add a dime sized amount, with a little water and distribute on your face with your hands (or if you prefer a loofah). The small (1.6 ounce) pump bottle is simple to use and doesn’t take up too much space in the cabinet or on the counter. There are some pretty nice ingredients that include tea tree oil, salicylic acid and aloe. I’ve used the product for a few days now and have not noticed any dryness or irritation. Nor have I noticed any redness or rashes. The scent of the cleanser is not strong (smells like tea tree oil) and does not linger long. And finally, what I like the most? This company has made a product in a bottle that is reusable. I really like companies who have a philosophy to reduce their impact on the world. Being socially aware of how their products can affect the environment and actively doing something about it is a company that I can support. You can reuse the bottle and add liquid soap or other things.",4
"Ordered this for my son and he really loves it. He finds that this kit is helpful because there are a variety of tools that address most skin issues. He also likes there is a kit that holds all of the tools which means that he can keep them together and doesn't have to look for them when needed.  And finally, this kit was affordable and even more reasonable than some that I have seen in several discount stores.",5
"This is perhaps one of the most difficult reviews that I have written in a while. Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can’t decide. I’m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn’t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven’t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven’t looked in the mirror and said “wow” or “gosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment”.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review. Otherwise, this review will stand.",3
"If you have larger head, these don't stay on. They're too tight and it causes them to slip strangely. I like the button idea though, and they worked fine for my regular headed coworkers.",3
While these are cute they definitely did not slide around easily on the nail in order to get them into the right position all.,2
Love this wig priced reasonably hair is silky soft it curls perfect length and I was able to get it same day,5
I've never had high blood pressure but my blood pressure goes up really high when I use this product. When I stop using it goes back to normal within 3 days. I've ran this experience twice to determine if its actually the Hairprin and I've gotten the same results both times.,2
"I do like this model, comes with a charging cord but no adapter for the wall, so I plug mine directly into my CPU.  I like that the cover locks, and read the instructions, it won't start until you have held the button for 3 seconds.",5
this mask is amazing. my face feels so soft and smooth after using it. pores look smaller too,5
"Nice! Same quality as I've had from others, but cheaper and with cases! Glass works so much better than other types of files. I'll never go back!",5
These felt like there were cardboard pieces inside the material so I had to return them. I was so excited to get these but once I felt them by excitement turned to disappointment. These are not worth 13.99 at all.,1
"I'll admit, I was skeptical. I have never used a mud mask before. But I needed something! My skin was bumpy, irritated, and had lots of blackheads. I tried all the face washes and cleansers and they didn't do much. So I tried the Radha Beauty Dead Sea Mud Musk. I was very impressed! I left it on for about 7 minutes. It gives a nice minty tingle the whole time. If it starts to itch, you've left it on too long, get it off! I put a wet, hot cloth on my face for a moment to loosen it a bit, then just wipe it off, bit by bit.<br />My skin was SO SMOOTH, clear, and nice looking! I actually got compliments! I use it once to twice a week, but no more than twice. It really, really helps the look of my skin.<br />I was very skeptical but now I'm a convert!",5
Love,5
Love this ! Great service too,5
Simply not strong enough to squeeze the paint from my oil paint tubes.  A cheap plastic version worked much better.,1
Tons of styles to choose from ranging from soft glam to dramatic.  Would be great for making gift sets for friends!,5
The quality of these items is really not that great. The combs and cape are pretty flimsy and everything feels inexpensive In general. This set would work if you really need it to but it'd be better to just pay slightly more for a better pair of scissors.,2
"I have a medium tan skin tone and this did not work for me at all. It's waaaay too light. Definitely meant for fair to light medium skin tones. This stuff is pretty pigmented so I wouldn't try it if you think it might be too light. It probably will be. Goes on pretty opaque and pigmented, it's almost a light/medium weight foundation. It does go in silky smooth and has a nice finish. I also like the pump and packaging. A bit of a scent to it, but it's not too bad. Wish they made this in more shades!",3
I've tried the regular ones and love those. These don't stretch quite as well and feel a bit tighter when I wrap it around. I think they're alright but I prefer the normal ones much more.,4
"The polishes in this set work wonderfully and the packaging is very nice and would make an excellent gift! Unfortunately I bumped the lamp off my table and it fell about 3 feet and stopped working...I didn't think it was much of a fall so I was pretty surprised it didn't turn on anymore.<br /><br />The lamp was compact and easy to use, fit one hand at a time. Fortunately I have another lamp but pretty bummed this one broke so easily.:/",3
"(307) These lases are a little more dense so they definitely give the look of wearing false lashes, in kind of a more dated kind of way. I feel like the more spread out and whispy lashes are a lot more trendy these days. Band is quite thick also. Besides the band, the lashes themselves are pretty good quality and don't have a plastic sheen to them which is great. Price and quality is comparable to drugstore.<br /><br />(309) Also have a thicker band but are much more Whispy and have that fluffy instagram lash to them. Very pretty! I like these a lot better than the 307's. I'd give these a 5 and a 307 a 3 so since they're the same brand, I will average the review to a 4.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!",4
"I have pretty long and decently full eyelashes so this mascara worked well for me as a daily mascara.<br /><br />Cute packaging, nice slim shape with cute design.<br /><br />I didn't find it to be too volumizing, but it does a good job at defining and lengthening.<br /><br />Formula was not very wet from first opening so this may dry out faster than others if not used up.<br /><br />My main issue with this mascara is the hard plastic applicator. It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already. The bristles just seem really hard and sharp!<br /><br />This could just be me having a problem for whatever reason, but thought I'd mention.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!",3
"Was interested in what this was going to feel like but I guess ""jelly"" really is the closest consistency to describe this.<br /><br />It more viscous than water and has a bit of ""bounce"" to it but doesn't feel oily or greasy. I apply it straight on my face, rub it in a bit, then add a bit of water to my hands, lather, then rub again. Then rinse k<br /><br />I have combo skin with drier cheeks and this doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Still feels moisturized.<br /><br />This product smells of roses pretty strongly but I actually love the way it smells so I don't mind at all.<br /><br />Wouldn't really recommend for eye makeup though, I did find it to sting a bit so I'm just gonna stick to micellar for my eye makeup.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!:)",5
"These scrunchies look great in person, especially the plain scrunchies, theyre a beautiful silk like material that has some shine to it. The plain ones also have a heavy duty elastic in them. I have super thick long hair and these do a great job of keeping my hair in a bun.<br /><br />Ive definitely overpaid for scrunchies at urban outfitters when these are just as nice if not nicer for sooo much cheaper. They're great!:)<br /><br />The little barettes are just okay, I find they pull my hair but the scrunchies are totally worth it.",5
A pretty MLBB velvety lip color.  The formula isn't nearly as drying as typical matte liquid lips. More of a velvety mousse like texture.<br /><br />I have medium tan skin and I'd say this is a nude pink shade on me so it may be a bit light for deeper skin tones.<br /><br />I discovered you can also use this as a cheek color as well! I dab a bit on the back of my hand and apply it from there. It's pretty pigmented on the cheeks so starting with less is better.,5
"I tried this a few times and couldn't help but feeling like it left residue on my face. I end up using my normal face wash afterwards to feel properly cleansed.<br /><br />To be fair I don't wear much face makeup so perhaps this might work better for someone that wears foundation. I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this. Seems like more work than is necessary and kinda makes me feel like it will clog my pores in the long run...",3
"You never know what you're gonna get with some of these beauty sponges, but this is definitely one of the good sets.<br /><br />The sponges are actually soft and don't absorb as much product as other sponges. I recently tried another brand that looked exactly the same but they were so hard and rubbery. These are soooo much softer in comparison. I don't feel like I'm softly punching my face like I do with the others😂<br /><br />Very easy to clean, after use and have no weird smell or anything. I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer. It has soft bristles and a solid handle.<br /><br />Overall I think this is an awesome quality set for a great price!!",5
I think this might work for people with smaller heads or smaller faces but I felt it wasn’t wider enough or thick enough to look good on me. The hair was very soft and real looking though!,3
I actually use these for crafts such as sanding off rough edges on resin castings. And they work great for that.,5
Nice small bottles for travel. I like being able to take my own shampoo with me because I hate the stuff they have in the hotels.,4
"What a HORRIBLE product! Initial unboxing looked promising until the STENCH hit my nose! There was no relief from it. I gently soaked it in cold water with a baby shampoo and gently stirred it in one direction. The water instantly turned dark muddy brown. I let it soak in clean water 3x until the murky, dirty water ran cleaner. Then added a nice rich conditioner and a small spritz of argan oil. But these two little wigglets literally lost their appearance but still kept that terrible smell. Please save yourself the effort; use a different manufacturer. If I could give this item a -5 (negative 5) stars I would! I know they won't refund me after I washed it.",1
"This set comes with all colors displayed, a top coat, base coat, and matte top coat, also a nail file. The colors are pretty similar to the pictures, but slightly different. These colors show as very opaque and even with 3 coats they arent like the pictures. The green is more neon/clear and required 3 coats. The rest I only did two coats and cured for 60 seconds each coat in a 120w lamp. The purple is more magenta and has some pink undertones. The yellow is a little more lime green as well. I used dehydrator and a primer and when I put the base coat on, it would not smooth out and was lumpy. I'm not sure if it was the dehydrator and primer or the base coat itself, but I had to scrape it off and opted to note use it at all. I've only had the polish on for about a day, but have done a lot and there is no chipping so far.",3
The wig is softer than most synthetic wigs and did not tangle for me and my son was playing in it. It is layered so it gives a more realistic look and has a little wave or curl at the ends. The part isnt really believable even with the lace. I would suggest a cap or hat over it. It did shed slightly for me when I was combing my hands through it.,3
"Using this item made me feel like I was in the dentist's office. It was easy to setup and use. I plugged the poer adapter in, filled it with water, added the nozzle until it clicked, and pushed the dial to turn it on. There are different nozzles and in the instructions it says one is for general use, one for periodontal pockets, and another for fresher breath. There were some other accessories as well. It comes with a storage for those accesories. I used the general use nozzle and noticed that the dial has no arrow to tell you what strength you're putting it to, you would only know while the power is on and the stream is going. On the lower setting, the water was spurting, not flowing smoothly, but did on a higher setting. There is a suspension control to pause it while using it. After you are done, it instructs you to dump the water. Overall, it worked as it should and I gave it four stars because of the spurting and no arrow on the dial.",4
"They are not as long as I expected. I don't think I paid attention to the length, but if i hook two together they work. They are very secure though. The sellers contacted me about the item and were very nice and helpful.",3
"I ordered these because they looked super soft and the details in each bow was beautiful. Received the first batch and they seemed tighter than what I wanted. Before I could contact the seller, they contacted me stating a batch was in circulation that was to tight. They shipped me out a new pair at no cost and even added an extra bow. I really appreciate the customer service. The new bows are beautiful and are super soft on my daughters kinky curly hair.",5
"My skin is very sensitive so I'm always careful to patch test and then I still can have trouble but this worked fine. Loaded with serum, there is plenty to pat in when the mask comes off. As usual, I had a bit of trouble getting the mask in exactly the right place and had to fiddle with it a bit but once it's in place it stays.",4
Seems to work but my neck definitely needs more help than I'll get from a cream. Moisturizes well and absorbs nicely. My sensitive skin didn't have any trouble. I did notice some improvement but it doesn't last through the day.,4
Easy to use and blends well. The dark color was a little darker than I would have liked but that's a color issue. The lighter color works well. Does the job.,4
"While I love the idea of this, the actual product just isn't there yet. The charge didn't last long enough to get my hair done (I do have long and thick hair) so YMMV but the second time I tried to use it, it seems that the charge didn't even last as long as the first. Too much trouble for me. I was hoping for a true rechargeable product which would be excellent--if only this one delivered.",1
"I really liked using these. They seemed to have a really good effect, without irritating my very sensitive skin. I'm always worried when I try something new -- I get redness, irritation and in bad cases hives so trying anything is a risk. I had absolutely NO problems with these and they left my skin feeling soft and supple and well moisturized.",5
"I got these to add to my travel bag so I don't have to keep taking my regular brushes in and out. These are good quality brushes, are soft and smooth and I didn't have any stray bristles anywhere. Overall very satisfactory. I'm happy I got them, they are getting used frequently and it certainly saves time to have 2 sets.",5
I travel a lot and find that using a mister for a lot of things makes it easier. The problem has always been that the bottles leak or don't mist. These work perfectly and don't leak!,5
"I’m using this for my body oil and it’s working perfectly. I wasn’t sure it would go through the sprayer but it does and it makes it so much easier to use. It’s a bit messy getting it started (oil you know) but once I got it primed, it’s working fine and I can spray when I finish in the shower and reach my back without help.",5
"I’ve been looking for a shower cap for a long time that is sturdy, the right size and doesn’t wear out after a few uses. This is promising although it’s bigger than I need/want - I’ll still use it until something better comes along. It is adjustable so it’s very usable just way oversized for my head and the amount of hair I have. It is lightweight and water proof and dries quickly so other than size, it’s great.",4
These work okay on natural nails but they don't seem to last as long as some of my older ones that are still in use years later. I generally only use them to touch up rough edges or file down broken nails but I couldn't swear to their durability. I can't imagine them working well on acrylics or gels but since I'm not using either right now I can only attest to the fact that they are working on my natural nails and seem to work okay I'm just not sure about their durability.,4
"This is a great Aloe Gel. I keep in the fridge and use it regularly. It’s light enough weight that it doesn’t feel goopy and washes off clean. Very thick, nice and cold from the fridge and it’s great for too much sun or too much kitchen (burns, cuts, grease spatters, etc.). Easy to use - no nasty smell and works.",5
I had a bit of trouble in the beginning getting this set exactly right for me but once it was set up (and I marked the spots the suction cups go onto) it's been a wonder. No more sore neck while soaking. I was worried about it staying damp but it doesn't. I do remove it when I'm not relaxing but it fits very nicely in my linen closet so it's only a second away.,4
"I've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up. I've been using them for several months and so far so good but if they do fall apart, I'm willing to invest in more expensive products. For a starter set, I would give this a try to be sure it works for you (and you are willing to do it).",4
"I wasn't really sure about this and when I first opened it I became even more skeptical. It looked like a paper towel and I had to wet it? Fortunately I thought ahead and opened it before soaking it in water and it was relatively easy to handle. I didn't love wearing it for 30 minutes, I got annoyed by then with the masque but 20 minutes was about my limit and I did see results. I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of problem for me to use (although I did patch test first). If you know what you are going into (the time and effort) I'd recommend this product. If you don't have the time or want to bother with soaking the masque first, try something else but this does work!",4
There are a number of this type of product on the market and this one does not compare favorably to any others that I’ve tried. They don’t hold well and I didn’t notice any improvement. I’ll keep shopping.,1
"Once I got comfortable using this, the hand part felt weird at first, I've seen decent results. I do use a cellulite gel and this brush and I can really see an improvement. I used the same combination a couple years ago and was very happy with my results but I fell by the wayside - I'm back and I'll continue to use it forever. Between the gel and the brush, the action of using the brush is the most important and I noticed results after a couple of weeks.",4
"Nice scrub with a pleasant scent. Easy to use, extremely gentle, and I was using on one side only so I can see a difference after about 3 or 4 uses.  Feels good, works well and no bad after effects, what more do you need?",4
"It is a thin piece of wire inside a cloth. Once twisted the clip loses shape - does not give desired effect, AND difficult to bring back to the original shape.<br /><br />Not worth the money.",1
Great,5
"I am not new to nail stamping, but I only recently became aware of She Modern Sticky Stamping Polishes. With traditional stamping polish it is necessary to work very quickly in order to successfully transfer the image onto the nail, and beginners frequently struggle to get the timing down. Even experienced stampers have difficulties with extremely fine lines or highly detailed images; the stamping polish just dries too quickly inside the very shallow etching. After watching several She Modern videos on YouTube and ordering a small set of sticky stamping polishes, I was eager to test them out on a stamping plate I’ve been unsuccessfully trying to use for over a year. My very first effort was flawless! The She Modern performed perfectly. Beginners will definitely find these polishes far, far easier to work with as they learn the basics, and more advanced stampers can enhance their artwork by using pigment powders, foils, and glitter. In addition, She Modern offers a comprehensive selection of watercolor polishes for techniques such as lead lining, reverse stamping, etc. The only limit is your imagination and She Modern even helps with that by providing live demonstrations of their products and techniques on YouTube every Tuesday and Friday. Tina very thoroughly and patiently opens each session by answering any questions from attendees before creating a nail design with various products. It’s very helpful to see them in use and gives you ideas for your own nail art. It’s a great line of products for nail artists at ANY skill level and the product support is outstanding!",5
It is exactly as described and perfect for young boys. Bought this for my 5 yr old,5
"I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.  Keep in mind, I have very little hair and it is very very fine.  This curling iron really make my hair look amazing.",5
"HOW THIS COMES<br />This bar of soap comes wrapped in plastic with a label on each side.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />This bar of soap is very crumbly before unwrapped.  The soap feels like it will crumble but when you put water on it, it turns into a very muddy bar of soap.  You can feel the mud in it.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />This does clean the skin well, but if you have normal to dry skin, it really does make it feel stripped and tight when done using it.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />There is nothing in this bar of soap to indicate its ingredients other than Dead Sea Mud.<br /><br />COUNTRY OF ORIGIN<br />Israel<br /><br />WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS<br />Anyone with very dirty greasy skin or who has problems with oil and blemishes might be able to use this.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This bar of soap does not list ingredients but you can definitely feel there is a lot of mud in it.  It cleans well but strips the skin.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  No ingredient list took a star off for me.  The performance is good for some skin, but mine is more on the normal to dry side so I don't use it as much as the guys do.",4
"I have been looking for some shampoos to help with cleaning hair, but also making the scalp heal for nice hair growth and also flaking.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes wrapped tight in plastic with the pump down.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />Once the plastic is open, you turn the pump to make it pop up and then you can dispense the shampoo.<br /><br />SIZE<br />The bottle is only 6 inches from the base to the top of the pump.  It is pretty small.<br /><br />SCENT<br />My mom found a really old bottle of shampoo in her attic that was by Fabrege called Farrah Fawcett shampoo.  This scent reminds me of that.  It is a really nice smelling shampoo.<br /><br />SCALP<br />I did feel some tingling in my scalp when using this.  It did not burn or hurt at all, it felt nice.<br /><br />HAIR CLEAN?<br />I have very fine hair which is easily weighed down.  It is hard to find a shampoo that encourages volume, does not make my hair look flat, and that does not make it full of static.  This shampoo leaves my hair clean for a few days and it somewhat encourages waves.  I can not comment on static, as it is not near winter yet.  My hair was not left dry or frizzy at all.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a nice shampoo.  It is a small bottle, but a little bit goes a long way.  It makes my scalp feel better and leaves my hair nice and clean.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I wish the bottle was not so small, but I do like the shampoo.  I was going to give this to my daughter (she has scalp issues) but I think I will buy her a 2nd one and keep this one for me.",5
"I have tried many high end skin products over time and I also make my own skin care which I use a lot as well.  Once in a while I like to check out another line to trade off for a while.  This line, Wow.  I am impressed so far.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box.  The bottle inside is glass with a lock pump top.  Turn to the side and you can pump and then turn it back and it locks.<br /><br />TEXTURE OF THE LOTION<br />This is what I would think of as a lotion texture.  Thick, but not too thick.<br /><br />MY SKIN TYPE<br />I tend to have normal to dry skin and it has some uneven patches on it which most probably don't notice, but I do.<br /><br />HOW I USE THIS<br />I start with the XXI cleanser which is great stuff.  Then I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum on my skin.  After that, I use this Vitamin C lotion and I finish with the XXI firming lotion on top of that.  I only do this 1 time at night.<br /><br />RESULTS<br />The results of this product line have been really impressive.  My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired.  I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired.  I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look.  It was quite exciting for me right now.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />My skin glows after using this.  It is soft, moisturized and when combined with the other XXI cleanser and firming lotion, the results are impressive.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will continue to buy products from this line (well the ones I mentioned, anyway).  I really have been thankful to have them right now.  They have given me a boost when I really needed one.",5
"I have baby fine hair.  That means that although I can make it look like I have quite a bit of hair, in reality, my pony tail is the size of a watercolor brush.  I need hair ties that can pull my hair back, stay put, and not destroy what hair I do have.<br /><br />HOW THESE COME<br />These come in a plastic bag.<br /><br />COLOR<br />The colors are all brilliant neon which I LOVE, except the blue- I would call it neon navy if that were a thing.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />These work perfectly for me.  I use them alone on hot days and even have them stay put during exercise and activity.  They do not tear out my hair when I remove them either.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These hair bands are perfect for me.  I have baby fine hair and not as much of it as it looks, so having these is perfect.  They also work well for kids.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I am thrilled to have these.  Most other hair bands slide out easily and frustrate me.  These stay put most of the time.",5
"As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.",5
"I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.",5
"I have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.",3
"I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.",5
"I am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.",4
"I am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, ""WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?""<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is decent, but not my favorite product at this point.",4
"I was spoiled.  I had a wonderful big compact mirror from OTT LITE some time ago.  I used it a lot.  However, it broke and I could not replace it.  I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.",3
"When it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices.  I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.",5
"When it comes to styling devices, my family all has different preferences because we all have different hair.  This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Great idea, just didn't work at all for us.",2
"I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.",5
"We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.",5
I am a total mascara girl won’t leave the house without it. This by far is the best collection. The weight of it is spectacular it doesn’t feel like you’re way down. The white tube gives you that volume and that length let it dry and then apply either one of the mascaras and you will see your eyelashes look like you’re wearing falsies. Love love love Tarte!!!!!!,5
Great assortment of color. Very pliable and easy to use. Done many a nail using these foils. Definitely a keeper. This NY girl approves,5
Not a fan of this polygel. It was hard to work with. I had to warm it in a cup of very hot water first to even be a little pliable. Even tho it has a little American flag on the advertisement it is not made in USA very misleading. I have used about 3 different polygel sets like this and this one was the hardest to use by far. But I gave it a try because the one I usually use was out of stock. I used all the different colors but all with the same ending.....disappointing!!!! So sad  because I had high hopes after waiting almost three weeks to receive it during these trying times due to covid. This NY GIRL unfortunately disapproves and is very disappointed!!!!!,3
Look great but nothing natural about it. She’d like crazy. I was hoping to love this wig but I really dislike it.,2
"This wig cost $18 and it feels super luxurious! The hair fibers are super soft and easy to manage! I love the ombré coloring, it is so nicely done! The wig looks super realistic, I wish my hair was actually like this!",5
I have purchased these swabs twice now and they never disappoint! They are tightly wound so no cotton falling off in my ears. I use them for hygiene purposes but I think the wooden stems make them great for paint/glue crafting projects!,5
"I ordered a set of MUSE & Co Dazzling Collection 36 Stick-On Gel Nails Medium Length, French Sparkle for review.  Having preteen and a teenager in the house who love all things beauty, I felt they may like these.  The set has both plain and bedazzled nails.  The being was just to big and stuck up too far, often catching on clothes.  The had pretty good adhesion for a day or two then began coming up.  Overall nothing special, but the did work temporarily.",3
"I ordered a set of 'Qiray 36 Pieces, 18 Colors Large Retractable Cotton Hair Ties Hair Bands, Suitable for All Hair Thickening Hairstyle' for review.  Both my daughters and wife have longer hair and go through a multitude of hair ties.  These are reasonably priced and are well made for hair ties.  My daughter told me these are her favorite hair ties.  They do not get caught up in her curls, nor do they get tangled when they are removed.  They have good stretch and hold her thick hair well.  These are nice and wide.  Overall, these are a good economical option for hair ties.",5
"I ordered the 'Padgene Makeup Vanity Mirror with Lights,1x 2X 3X 5X 7X Magnification 360°Adjustable Rotation 4-Fold 34 LED Lighted Mirror with Touch Screen,Stand Height & Brightness Adjustable (White)' for review.  This mirror comes fully assembled and is quite simple to use.  It has a touch button to turn on the light.  It has multiple magnifications.  The ability to fold it up so it takes less space is also beneficial making it easier to store or take up less space on your counter top.  The mirrors are clear without scratches or flaws.  The stand is plastic, so it may not be as durable as a mirror with a metal base or stand.  The price point does seem a little high for the quality, but my wife really likes this mirror and uses it everyday.  Overall, this is a well made mirror with great magnification.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful!",4
"I ordered 'Native Deodorant - Natural Deodorant - 3 Pack Seasonal' for review.  this set comes with three different scents  Each scent is light and not overpowering.  The deodorant is soft and goes on smoothly.  My wife, who has to use an extra strength deodorant has been pleased with the odor control.  Her sensitive skin has no issues with this deodorant.  Overall a great natural product.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!",5
"I ordered a ‘Boar Bristle Hair Brush with Nylon Pins for Thick Curly Long Wet Hair - Anti Static Brush Oval - Wooden Paddle’ for review.  My wife has curly hair that can be difficult to tame.  When this brush arrived, my younger daughter who has very long curly hair wanted to try it out.  When she brushed through her hair, she felt it reduced the static and made her hair feel softer.  So much so that my wife never got the chance to use as my daughter claimed it as hers.  The brush handle is made with a thick, durable feeling wood.  The bristles are much more durable and pull through the hair better than those with plastic or silicone bristles.  Overall, this is a nicely made brush, that works well, and worth its price point.",5
"I ordered the 'Beast Blue Beard Oil with Organic Argan & Jojoba Oils, 1 fl oz' for review.<br />I love to try different beard oils. This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It's a very ""cologne"" type scent which I really don't care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn't like the scent at all.",3
"I ordered this Veta – Lash and Eyebrow Serum – 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen for review.  My teenage daughter was willing to try it out for me and these are her thoughts.  ""The pen application is not difficult.  However, if you accidentally get it in your eyes it stings really badly.  I had used it a couple of times before that happened. But, now I don't want to use it again.""<br /> Unfortunately she did not use it long enough to see if there was any lash growth.  If my wife is brave enough to try it I will update my review.",3
"I ordered the 'Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Leakproof Foldable Squeezable Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap (Pack of 2)' for review. My daughter has her favorite hair products that she has to pack when we travel and it's never fun packing those large bottles and other travel containers are just to small and or hard to fill. This set is so nice with the wide mouth openings which make them easy to fill and as you use the product, up they collapse to take up less space plus make it much easier to get every last drop of that precious product out haha. We have tried other compact TSA approved toiletry containers and I will say that these are so much more functional than the others, and most definitely of greater value.",5
"I like that this is aluminum free, made in Germany, etc. The scent isn't ideal for me. I'm sensitive to fragrance and this is very strong. Smells like baby powder. I prefer the men's scents which are usually more toned down but I couldn't find a Nivea men's without aluminum.",3
"Other than my husband saying this looks like a torture kit from the movies, this little set has a lot of options for the price.  My husband had no idea how to use most of the tools it comes with, and frankly, there are a few that have even stumped me. But, I love the masculine black look of the tools and so did he. The packaging looks very nice and professional and the leather is soft and bends easily—this made it easy to tuck it into a larger bathroom bag. All of the clippers seem to work well without issue. I did take one star off because the little pair of scissors are really thin and flimsy. The first time my husband took them out to cut his large toenail, it bent them. But, other than that, the rest seem well made and sturdy and he said he will continue to use them... and secretly, I want him to have his own pair so he quits taking mine out of my makeup bag and losing them. :)",4
"For me, I had tried many times to deal with a couple of spots on my skin. Nothing I tried worked, so I then I was this and thought I'd try it. After a couple of weeks of putting it on those spots, they are almost gone. I would recommend that you try it if, like me, you tried everything without success.",4
Good thought mask were included ?,5
"This is a nice sized palm brush - slightly smaller than some I've seen, and easy to handle. The boar bristles are a nice moderate stiffness and seem to do a good job, even with my thinning hair. Boar bristles are known.to provide benefits to the scalp as well as redistributing natural oils through your hair.",4
"The scent you can feel? I wasn't certain what that could mean, but now that I've used it, I get it. I dont know if it's the caffeine or the tea tree oil... or maybe its eucalyptus, but it does have a tingling effect on your skin. And that tingling effect is not just some slight effect, its noticable. In fact, certain times (and xertain areas of skin), it's almost too much. As such, I dont use this daily.<br /><br />As for scent - it is a strong but pleasant scent that smells like it feels... and again, it strikes me as a bit strong. I have some Beast ""Blue"" beard oil that has the same scent. It cleans nicely and the scent stays with you as you go about your day.",3
"This beard oil from ""The Beast"" seems like it's pretty good for the health of your beard. It's only got a cou po le of ingredients, argon oil and jojoba oil... similar to some other beard oil I've tried. And it does seem to keep your beard soft and shiny. It also lists a scent among its ingredients. The scent is certainly ""manly"", but to me, it's more of an oil like scent... It's not unpleasant and it's not overpowering... but there.",4
"Lots of tools in a compact set. I was afraid this set might be huge, taking up too much precious space in a suitcase for travelling. But not...  in fact, they've done a nice job of effort iently using space in this leather, folding case. The tools themselves are decent... not great, but they'll get the job done and the fact that they've got just about any need covered makes this an ideal item to toss into a suitcase for a trip. Nicely packaged, it would also make a nice gift.",4
I scratched my eyebrows trying to get the pencil color onto my brow.,2
Not great for a wider face. The stencil is not wide enough.,2
Great disposable shower cap for coloring  your hair or using purple hair masks at home. I should have bought these years ago.,5
"I used this scrub right before shaving my legs and it made the floor of the shower extremely slippery. I didn't mind that, but the scrub leaves behind a super thick layer of candle wax looking stuff that was impossible to get off my legs. I had to scrub with a washcloth and soap to even make a dent. While shaving, huge globs of the candle wax looking stuff were on the razor. I love bath and body works, but they really missed the mark on this one",2
I have used this product for years .Anytime my tummy is upset I take a couple of drops and it always makes it feel better .,5
"Wow! I was hesitating about ordering this product because of the price and after reading multiple reviews about different colors of the same polish that didn’t have application thick enough. There were no reviews on this color (authentic apricot) and I decided to give it a try. I must say that I’m very pleasantly surprised. The picture I attached was taken on the 4th day after application and this is ONLY 1 COAT! Usually, all nail polishes start peeling the same day, because I do a lot cooking/cleaning but this one holds so well, I’m just amazed. And I should say that with the clean ingredients list and such a strong application it’s worth the price. I felt like I had to leave this review to support the seller. Thank you to the company for making such good products!",5
This beard wash has a great and real sandalwood smell. Lathers well and has a great cleaning effect on the beard. Love it.,5
"This shampoo isn't as good as the reviews had led me to believe. It's very difficult to lather, and somewhat aggravated my scalp. Perhaps okay in a pinch, but recommend you look at other options.",3
Great product,5

I can not smell any fragrance with this at all,<br />this is best used in light applications for body and hair- a little goes along way! Its NOT gloppy like olive oil/almond/canola, seems lighter than grape seed oil even.<br />Worth the $. I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it- lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work. It is a God send for unruley eyebrows. It washes right out no residue. I do this 2 times a week. I live in the desert/New Mexico/hard water/50 yrs/unprocessed thick semi curly hair. My hair shines but its not oily looking after washing, it semi tames and makes it so much better...it looks alive and healthy. My beautican is astounded. I have found its so much cheaper and works far much better than high scale salon items. It feeds your hair and body.<br />How I apply this I squeaze a small amount (pea size) onto one palm then rub my hands/palms quickly together till oil is warm- then lay my hands on area and massage in-it sinks right into dry scaley elbows, chapped lips, wind burned knees- etc. it does leave a light very fine oil film if it doesnt soak in 100%. If that happens it doesnt stain my clothes.<br />Oddly I have found for some reason it heals skin/cuts/wind burn more quickly than salves.<br />I keep my oil bottle on the (metal) end of an old frozen OJ tube style container- making a tiny saucer in case a drop oil seeps out.<br />Just my 2 cents....",5
Love them. Think and very enjoyable to use,5
Great hair spray.  It keeps my difficult to style hair in check with just a whisper of spray.  I’ve relied on it for years.  Great product!,5
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loved it and has started to shop for more.  She is in the cosmetology industry and fashion forward.  I'm not surprised she knew about this cool product.,5
Nice clips. Sturdy. Doesn’t pull fine hair out.,5
"Good product, smells good",5
"I enjoy this set. The bristles are a bit soft. I have to comb out my hair first, then use the brush. I have VERY thick hair, so a stiffer bristle would have been a bit better, but overall I am happy.",5
It’s quite and nice small size!,5
Great sprayer for my hair when it’s dry and needs refreshing before washing. Spray stream  is steady and voluminous; saving me the trouble of getting into the shower to wet my hair.,5
"Smooth, good looking, fits in my pocket. The best.",5
"Like all OZ products, this one is a winner too. You can feel the serum working within 2 minutes after application. After 5 days off use I can see a difference in the tone of skin-brighter, tighter, and a noticeable reduction of fine lines. Great product, great price=win win.",5
"SheCotton Premium Cotton Rounds for Face is lint free. Like that  it does not come apart easily for nail polish, make-up removal, etc. You don't get pieces of cotton fibers all over. Recommend.",5
Great hair,5
"So i have curly hair and lately since quarantine its been shedding more than usual, so i decided to throw away all the products i was using including my brush, i ordered these with my fingers crossed that it works as good as it says in the reviews and today i used it for the first time and thank you Jesus ! it slid through my hair and i had very minimal shedding !! i am so happy with these brushes and hello u get 2 for $5.88!!! if you have super knotted hair like me and you shed alot, get these soooooo worth it",5
"Got this glove after trying other brands, it came quick and I was excited to use it. The glove is soft and it fits my hand perfectly which helps the glove stay on and not sure off when I’m applying my self tanning creams ! Def a must have !!!!",5
Works well. Only use once or twice a week.<br />Holds style in hair well. Nice smell.,5
love this product,5
Just received the brush opened it up and begin to use it on my couch. Bunches of the horse hair fell out of the brush immediately.,1
Product was late arriving.  Amazon refunded price and did not need product returned.  Overall did not see much difference with dry skin.  Used daily.,3
"This is a lip stain, not lipstick. And yes, they're cotton swabs. You break one end so it flows to the other, and there's a LOT of stain in each cotton swab (there's 20 in the box, each wrapped in plastic). I think you can get two uses out of each one, but obviously, they're meant for single use.<br /><br />This stain works VERY well. The I am Fine color is reddish-brown, but it was a very nice red color on my lips. And my fingers - be careful when you apply these since they do stain. It's best to exfoliate before you use them, and to line your lips since I noticed a bit of bleeding/feathering when I used the product. Nothing that was obvious unless one was very close, but it would be prevented from lining my lips which I don't normally think to do when using a stain. Then again, the applicator is a cotton swab (so no fine control) and you get a LOT of product with it.<br /><br />It does last all day unless you eat something greasy/buttery. So this would be great for going out for drinks or doing anything where you avoid greasy food. Also, the instructions on the box are in Chinese.",4
"What I like about this set is that you get three different colors with this set, in case you need to blend to match your brow color (you can always give away the ones you don't use), and that it includes an eyeliner as well. Both worked well (they weren't dried out for me at all), flowing easily and with good lasting power. A great set for the price.",5
"I've read about these and wanted to give them a try; you wet them with warm water (or micellar water) then wipe with off your makeup with them. They really do work, and feel so nice since they're very soft! Sometimes I press them gently against my eyes for a moment or two to help remove the more stubborn makeup, or gently rub. You wash once they're full of makeup, putting them in a garment bag, and I try to put them in a wash with no fabric softener.",5
"This is a great makeup sponge and works just as well as others that cost a lot more. You can use it damp or dry (I moisten it when I'm applying liquid foundation, but can use it dry when cleaning up eye shadow or applying some blush). It's nice and soft so it feels good against the skin, and applies the makeup in an even fashion.",5
"Okay, I love eyeshadow palettes and probably have too many, and they range in price and brand. I definitely love the 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, and this reminds me of a Huda palette I have with similar shades. It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get. The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte. I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this. That's not to mean it won't work better on other people.<br /><br />Still, for the price it's a nice range of colors and a fun palette to play with, so it's worth a try.",3
"I've heard of face cream made from snails (or their secretions) and was a bit hesitant to give it a try. This is from Korea so perhaps that's not so surprising, and has a nice citrus scent to it, is a nice thick cream (no SPF) that does a really good job moisturizing my skin. It absorbs quickly and gives it a nice, dewy look and does seem to provide some tightness to it.",4
"I'm pretty happy about the LumaRx facial cleansing brush. It is designed very ergonomically and is very comfortable to hold during use. The tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use. The instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening. It has illustrations which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the T-zone. The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter – this is important to me as I have a small bathroom. Also, the LumaRx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation.",5
"didn't work for me... slides off, have tried to wear it on either side and still the same.  So this product is not for me, SORRY!",2
Save your money and squirt some lotion of any variety into a produce bag and wrap it around your feet. It is the same exact experience.,2
so cute,5
"Not even a tiny bit flexible, don't work well. Wish I had returned them,",2
These are thick and difficult to use. Impossible for me to get even one stripe that I liked. It would have been impossible for me -- and probably anyone else who wasn't a professional -- to make my hair look like the photo in the description.,1
This is the only shampoo I use any more. Hair feel nice and soft,5
Great,5
Just what I needed for school since I find it really hard to put my hair in a clean bun. Definitely a lifesaver. Great buy!,5
"I really like this one, I’ve purchased many different Papa Recipe masks and they are always my favorite!",5
"Got it for the cute packaging but the product itself did not disappoint. I love BB Cream and Missha always makes some great ones! Packaging is so cute, the compact itself is a bit bulky but that’s ok. :)",5
"I’ve been using this to style a drag wig and it’s been great. Very adjustable and sturdy. I love that I can fit it into my carry-on for travel. The peg is a bit narrow for my styrofoam heads, but I just wrap it with duct tape to snug things up.",4
These are basic clips for styling hair. I use mine for blow drying and straightening. Great and doss what they're supposed to do.,5
Didn't work AND killen my hair,1
"I've been on the mascara hunt to replace my old L'Oreal love for literally years, and unfortunately the hunt continues. This mascara was very underwhelming. In fact, I used it once and forgot about it, which as a frugal woman is kind of shocking. It's fine. Nothing great. Nothing terrible. Meh.",3
Leaves my hair very smooth so my comb does not get caught up. I like how it make my hair look fuller and i have noticed less of my hair falling out in the shower.,5
"So far I love this.  The scent is a very true rose, no chemical harshness or soapy smell.  i've only used it a few times so i will have to see if the scent continues through all the way and is not just on surface levels.  The feeling also is great-it lathers in a very creamy soft way, and again, does not feel soapy.  I would very much recommend.<br />i have a question for the seller if they see this.  Do you make a lotion to go with it?",5
My favorite,5
This is a heated eye mask.  Not to be confused with the mask you wear to fight crime.  This is more a mask you’d want for pain religion from headaches I think<br /><br />I like the design overall and think it’s nice<br /><br />Seems nice and felt soft.  Hopefully it works well for you. Check with your doctor just incase,5
[[VIDEOID:ade4de95e55ad39950dd58a2a5e4561c]] This seems like a nice unit.  I don’t know much about mail drills but this did feel light and I liked the design<br /><br />Overall I thought it was nice and looked good.<br /><br />The finish was nice and everything arrived safely.,5
[[VIDEOID:b434b0b7b922fd48028d610c4fef3e38]] Take this out and you can smell it.  Definitely seems like it’ll be effective.<br /><br />I can see this being good for multiple places not just car engines.<br /><br />Overall I’d say it’s nice and I think will work well,5
Works ok.  Helps a bit doing my daughters hair,2
Easy to use - does the job and removes hair aell<br /><br />Edit: probably used this three times and it broke,1
I feel like it's good for shaking things up.,5
These are decent for the price. My skin is normal so they work for me BUT if you have greasy skin I wouldn't suggest this product.,4
They were okay but lifted after a few days n came off even with 3 layers of top coat.,2
I love the texture of this lip color and its velvety finish. The deep vampish color is another plus. However I wish its staying power could be improved. Nevertheless I plan to buy it again.,4
"It didn't work for my issue,  but it was kind of a long shot anyway",3
"I'm not big on fragrances especially artificial,  perfumey stuff.  This has a nice clean scent that compliments my natural smell.  It keeps me dry and comfy even on very hot days.",4
"I bought this for my homemade herbal tinctures.  Unfortunately,  the top was damaged and leaking.",2
"I love lemon balm and I even grow my own.  I wanted to buy some to get me through the winter,  but this is not it.  I have no idea what it is, but it tastes like grass.  It's definitely not lemon balm.  At least I didn't spend too much on it.",2
"[[VIDEOID:cb9b4f9df532525269b6bd626cc29f60]] I have heard horror stories about people accidentally gluing their eyes shut with eyelash adhesive.  My sister wanted to try some for her wedding and I thought this would be a safer option.  It's as easy as applying eyeliner.  The magnets on the back of the lashes automatically stick to the eyeliner and stay in place until you remove them.  They seem well made and look natural.  The set includes 8 pairs of lashes, a case with a mirror,  the special eyeliner,  and even a pair of tweezers made for eyelashes.",5
"I bought this for my sister who is having a baby.  Her nursery has a black and white theme which kind of makes me feel like I am inside a domino,  but this fits in great.  A full sized refill pack of diaper wipes fits in it easily so there's no guesswork about how many to put inside.  The silicone lid ensures that it is airtight and the wipes don't dry out.  I mainly bought it for the big container,  but I really like the travel one that it came with too.  It's easy to fill and has a handle little handle for carrying it.",5
"I bought these for a friend who does theater.  He has to wear a lot of pancake makeup that is kind of hard to remove.  These are so much better than regular makeup wipes because of the texture and strength.  He can use a dry one first off to wipe away a lot of it then another one with make up remover to clean off the rest.  Afterwards,  he can throw them out instead of trying to wash a dirty washcloth every time.",5
I bought these for my daughter who loves unicorns.  She is also on the autism spectrum so she has a lot of sensory problems.  Brushing her hair can be a challenge because she hates when it pulls her hair.  These are a great idea because they are so comfortable.  The plastic bristles massage her scalp and the paddle shape smooths her hair without snagging.  Plus she loves the cool unicorn designs.,5
"I bought these for my daughter who loves cosmic bowling.  I thought these would be great for tying her hair up and would look nice under the blacklight.  They are made out of a fluffy chenille material that is super stretchy.  They look nice in regular light, but really shine under a black light.",5
It fell apart after a few uses,2
"I bought these for my son who is on the autism spectrum.  Because of his sensory issues,  he hates the ear loops on his mask that he wears to school.  These are super comfortable and the mask loops can be moved to the side buttons.  I was a little concerned that he would get hot wearing a hat all day, but they are very lightweight and breathable.",5
"These are not faux fur headbands. These are real FUR headbands. They’re very nice, they’re soft and warm. They are Lightweight. Give them a try if you don’t mind real fur.",5
Easy to use,5
"The box was damaged but the brush, works perfectly. I washed it with a cleaner and its is so soft. 10/10 would buy again. Also Bésame has an online store.",5
Comfortable nice colors,5
Waste of money it doesn't stay cold for longer than 5 minutes,1
Nice quality and well designed. Easy to use.,5
Love the scent!,5
"Great cleansing lotion for a delicate area. I like that this adds some moisturizing where you might need it and leaves a nice clean feeling. If you want to feel clean<br />and need a soothing feel left behind, this works great.",5
These silicone face scrubbers are a little bigger than others I've used but it helps cover my area on my face when cleaning. The little nubs are longer and feel more pointed but these work at giving your skin a little extra scrubbing without injuring the skin. Easy to clean and should be easy to keep clean. Would also work at cleaning your makeup brushes.,4
"Great if you're heading out for a trip. There's 15 pads in a little container so makes it easy to use. The pads clean well and are gentle to use. One step cleaning and easy to tote with you to the gym, plane or wherever you need a clean up.",4
"I need a good face scrub to clean out the pores but it needs to be gentle at the same time to not inflame my skin. This scrub didn't really irritate my skin but the granules in the scrub are very rough. I found it to be more so than other scrubs I've used. Thankfully, it didn't irritate my skin. I just had to be extra gentle. That said, my skin was smooth again so it does work.",4
"I was not able to use this product as intended since it was in several pieces when it arrived. I liked that it was spf50 to protect the skin on my face but unfortunately, I can't use it.",1
"I ordered the pink headband set and these are really cute styles. The material is good and the band fits my small head well. If your head was on the larger side, they'd stretch but might feel tight behind the ears. They're durable and will keep my hair in place.",5
"I use essential oils for many purposes and this 3 piece set is a great starter kit for those who love lavender, lemon and peppermint. They smell great and are very versatile. Mix them with your favorite oil (I like coconut) and apply topically or add a few drops to a diffuser for a peaceful night sleep. I recently had a cold and mixed the peppermint and coconut oil and applied to my chest for a cough. It was soothing and helped with the sinuses as well. Makes a great gift because it comes in a cute little box as well.",5
They put me to sleep in 10 mins! Very addicted-))))) They smell nice!,5
Colors are NOT like the pictures. Very sheer and the magnet does not do anything. Don't waste  your money,2
Great quality! Just what I expected!,5
"This natural hand cream has a lovely pear scent and really moisturizes very well without feeling greasy. It is a very small ""cute"" jar and is a bit pricey for the size. It is a great hand cream. Will want to purchase again.",5
I really like this color stick. The pink lemonade is so pretty and leaves just a little shimmer on your skin. For me it lasted a day on my face so that was good. The package is small but still good for the price. I'm happy with this purchase.,5
"I can't say enough good things about these versatile Wonder Clips by Handi Stitch.  I recently received a package of 50 of these with 10 large clips and have used them on a daily basis for so much more than just holding fabric together for stitching seams.  Even this small size holds together leather so I find that I don't need to rubber cement the pieces together as I have done in the past to hold the pieces together.  Kids love these, too, so be prepared to find that you need more than you ever anticipated.  I received samples for evaluation and love these clips.",5
"eb5 line has been around for some time now and I have noticed their advertisements in print media over the years, but have not tried any of the line until I received this bottle of Collagen Booster Serum.  I am very surprised that I like this serum as much as I do, and I am more surprised at the competitive pricing for the entire line.  With no added fragrance, my sensitive skin responded well to the light and creamy product that was readily absorbed.  My skin was prepared for moisturizing and there was no irritation or annoyance due to a fragrance of the natural components which can occur.  The pump action is terrific and the cap keeps it protected from the elements, yet it is quick to remove for application.  There is no excessive packaging, so little waste.  Many years ago, Robert Heldfond Jr. and I were casual friends in San Francisco, occasionally having coffee together in North Beach, and I have thought of him each time I would see his father's picture in the advertisements I mentioned earlier.  I very much like to support family businesses and am pleased to finally try the product from his company which now has his wife at the helm.  I look forward to trying other products in the line.",5
"Plastic and/or acrylic organizers come in all sizes, shapes, configurations and qualities.  MelodySusie® has blown me away with this three part, multiple sectioned organizer with drawers.  Just so you're clear, you get a base with four drawers, each with an flattened oval shaped pull, each lined with a black textile that can be removed or used as you choose.  The edges of the drawers are beveled, giving this an aura of elegance, but most importantly, each drawer slides in and out with ease, regardless of whether or not the drawer is packed or empty.  The bottom of the base has a little strip in the form which raises this organizer from sitting directly on the counter, so if it is used in a bathroom, air can circulate around the entire piece and grungy mildew and such is reduced from forming.  Don't forget to dust, though.  The exterior edges are beveled, giving them a very finished appearance, unlike those sharp edges on many similar products in the marketplace.<br /><br />Included with this organizer are two additional pieces, each is the same dimension as the interior of the top ridge of the chest organizer, so you can decide which one you want to put on top and which one you want to put next to the main component.  Or you can separate them entirely and use the top of the organizer to put items and use the two multi-sectioned components separately.  You could line them up side by side along a dresser top and have more width rather than extended height.<br /><br />I love the assorted sizes of the sections and the angles top of the shorter of the two pieces.  I also love the rounded design in the sections of the taller component.  Every aspect of this trio is outstanding, high quality, and it makes quite the impression in addition to comfortably storing whatever you like in each compartment.  Each edge is finished, every detail has been considered, and it is even practical in that it can quickly be cleaned with no harsh detergents. This lovely item was made in China and it is clear that quality control is important to the manufacturer because I saw no defect even after intense examination.  Be prepared for a weightier set than you might expect, because there was no skimping on the materials.  It is perfectly packed for protection and is ideal for presenting as a gift.  It is well worth its price point.  A sample was provided for review.",5
Love the feel on my skin.  Product arrived in tact--all good.,5
Felt odd and looked off,2
Great polish- helps your nails heal. Needed this for covering mail with fungal infection. Actually helped mail improve!<br />Great stuff- beautiful color!,5
I love this item.  It invigorates my back while taking a shower.,5
Love them. I have been looking for them in stores fir years.,5
"Great, product. Love ordering from Amazon.",5
"I can’t tell any difference in time charging my IPhone or IPad using the USB C cable 65W.  I brought my regular Apple charger, USB port on my weekend trip and it charged in the same time.",3
"It great to use on your heels, if you have hard heels.",4
This kit has many dental tools including tweezers and flashlight.,5
"compact sized, nice stocking stuffer.",5
If you are looking for a scented beard balm then this ain't the one. Not an attractive scent at all for the price. Two thumbs down!,1
"Does nothing for my daughters thin curly hair. The bottle arrived with no top on it, the smell is terrible it makes my daughter cough when I spray it on her hair and it leaves hair feeling greasy. Needless to say I would not buy this product again.",1
Good quality.,5
"I like this product because of the natural ingredient list.  I do not like the smell as it goes on as it smells like tea tree oil to me even though that is not in the product.  The smell does dissipate after 20 minutes.  It is rich and creamy, but not greasy.  I have not noticed any improvements in my skin.  I will continue to use it until it is done, but will not re-purchase.",3
This cleanser is amazing.  What a wonderful feeling.  It smells terrific and is quite cooling.  I cannot wait to see my skin after a few weeks; I just know the results will be fabulous.,5
"I was extremely skeptical about ordering this product. I experienced hair loss ( telegenic effluvium ) after having Covid. This shampoo and conditioner helped open the hair follicles. What I liked most about it is, it’s natural. It smells good and did not irritate my scalp.",5
"I use this when I blow dry my hair straight. It’s moisturizing, not sticky and very light feeling. Helps with fly always. It’s on the expensive side but you don’t need a lot of product. For me it lasts a few months",5
So many crystals and organized by size and color. The tools work perfectly! Thank you so much this is definitely the best and deserves a lot more sales. They’re as high quality as Swarovski crystals with normal diamond color and also pink color. Highly recommend.,5
Perfect for a stamp,5
"They are comfortable and warm. Buy a half size larger to one size,to be safe.",5
I got the &#34;Glorious&#34; color combo and it's a good collection of bright and dark colors for almost every need. They are easy to apply and stick to my nails well that last for at least one week with a top coat.,5
A good collection of colors for French Manicure. Each one requires a minimum of 2 layers to allow sufficient coverage. However it doesn't last very long.,4
"surprisingly nice, well made wig I don't know how they can sell it at this price. Bought it for my wifes costume but  looks good enough to be worn for any reason.",5
Kind of slips when I sleep but good for everyday use,5
Very comfortable and relaxing. Helped eyes with my drops a lot,5
This does leave a residue on your hands for quite a while after putting it on.,3
"The shapes are a little flat and flimsy, good concept you just have to reinforce them if you plan to wear more than an hour. The store bought ones are thicker.",2
"This shampoo is for babies but based on the reviews here I decided to take a chance on it and I'm using it on my hair and so is my teen daughter.  I have bleached blonde wavy hair that constantly frizzes in the summer, in the rain, if I don't dry it enough - you get the idea, it is often frizzy.  I tried it and it does a great job cleaning my hair and the smell is just amazing.  However, I can't say that it's been a real miracle that changed my hair.  I mean, I like it but based on some of these reviews, maybe I was just looking for a miracle for bad hair and it isn't, at least for my hair.  I accidentally ordered two bottles of this when I intended to order one, and I plan to use them up, but I'd probably try something else after I'm done with the two bottles to see if there is some type of miracle for my dry/frizzy hair.",4
"Does what it is supposed to do.  Seller shipped it right away the next day.  Just have patience when you order it , because US customs held the cream for several weeks, before sending it to me. Was happy to finally get it, because my mom in Germany recommended it highly to me. I do recommend the seller.",5
"Purchased these to travel international without checking in luggage.  Different countries have varying standards on liquids in carry on luggage and no matter what country, these containers will meet those standards.  If you use these for an over night stay somewhere, or have an unexpected stay at an airport hotel, they should be able to hold enough supplies for that, but not for more than maybe 2 days.<br /><br />They are sturdy plastic, opaque containers and are flexible enough to squeeze the contents out. The caps are push in type and is better than the lift up caps where the cover can easily break off.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, when you buy other travel container sets, I find that a few of the containers are useless, like the spray bottle and the little &#34;pill&#34; container with the screw off lid, at least for my needs.  This particular set has all of the type of containers that I needed, and more than enough for all the products that I carry.",5
Buy these. They feel great and work quickly! So good for a quick refresh or self care night,5
My daughter loves this lip balm it is very nourishing on her lips she normally gets chapped lips really bad spot silver the winter time because she has eczema but this helps a lot no need to get one for me😰😂😂😊,5
Mildly effective. Nothing near as powerful as the Zero K wipes. But then also considerably cheaper.,3
"I get perfume samples from Birchbox, and this lets me make EDT sprays that aren't as overpowering and last longer (by volume, not by scent on arm). I love it! Also works well with essential oils for my stinky homemade mosquito sprays. I also have some perfumes that I love but which are too overpowering for my own sensitive nose, so I like diluting them with this perfumer's alcohol so they are more pleasant to wear.",5
"This is, I think, my third order of Rio De Keratin. I'm able to get 3-4 treatments out of each kit with my hair ranging from super short to just below my shoulders. I usually still iron my hair, but it stays flat, even in Alabama's subtropical humidity. Otherwise, it doesn't matter what I do: by the time I walk from my house to the car, my hair is frizztastic. But with a keratin treatment, I can even just blow dry my hair and it look fantastic. This saves so much more time and it makes styling last for days. I also hike and get sweaty and my hair still looks great after it dries. Once, after a day of kayaking, I rode in the back of a friend's truck back to the marina, and my hair still looked terrific. This of all things has given me the hair I've dreamed of. And at $10-$15 per treatment, this price is right.<br /><br />Of course, it does smell terrible. And the fumes can sting your eyes, both as you apply it to your hair and as you iron it out. I like to open the back door and aim a cyclonic fan into the bathroom while I use this stuff so I don't choke on the fumes.",5
"Since there aren’t any reviews for this product, I thought I would write one for those who aren’t familiar with the brand, or the item. I’m now 66 years old and have been using only La Prairie products for my face since 2009/10. My face looks better than ever because of it. This item in particular is a very gentle, easy to apply and use, facial cleanser that doesn’t require any water or actual washing process. It goes on a cotton pad (not the balls!), and not too much either, and you gently wipe your face and eye lids going in a circular motion - and always apply outwards and upwards. This will help your skin from being pulled down, which can cause more wrinkles. The company has changed the exact name of the product, but it’s the same (only an improved version) as it always has been. For me, I use this as the first step in my nightly facial ritual - which is to cleanse the face. I follow with other products in stages, finishing up with the moisturizer (one for the face and a different one for the eyes). My rating of this being sold online is hard, since it’s a wonderful product, however it’s outrageously overpriced for what’s a ‘trial size’ and ‘free’ gift, given out with purchases of a full size La Prairie item (depending on how much you spend, and where you buy, it might be just one of multiple free trial size items). The FULL size of this item is about $100 USD, and it’s around 8 ounces +/-. The bottle is probably 8” high and a couple inches wide at least. So part of my rating is based on the product itself and the other part is on the price for this size. Another thing I want to mention is that I have sensitive skin and have never had any issues with this product line! You’re face will thank you!",3
"I liked this particular scent much more than others that I've tried, from both Michel Design and other brands. The peony has a distinctive smell to it but unfortunately it doesn't last long enough after taking a shower. The bar is a large oval shape and a little awkward to use at first - it gets easier as it's used more. The design of this and other products from MDW is very pretty and would make a nice gift for someone too. The soap has a LOT of creamy lather that that rinses clean and doesn't leave much soap scum on the shower walls. I have tried other triple milled soaps from L'Occitaine, Pre de Provence, Australian Soap Works, and 2 others that I can't readily recall the name of. All these are similar in price but the quality of this is much better, at least in my opinion. I have found that some fragrances are a bit stronger than others and I think it's just a matter of choosing one over another according to preference. This company makes so many different things for the kitchen and bath and I have bought quite a number of them for myself and plan on buying more for gifts. I noticed one review of this scent that said it had an awful smell to it, whereas mine is good - unfortunately this can happen if the bar is old and depending on the seller. This doesn't mean that every bar of soap is bad! My only negative comment is that the peony scent doesn't last long enough!",5
This is one of La Prairie's less expensive moisturizers and it's good. It can be used day and/or night alone or over a serum or one of their other products per directions. I use this cream during the day because I don't really need a sunscreen. I've also used this at night when I run out of night cream. In my opinion all of La Prairie's products are excellent and worth the high price - I don't use makeup so it's important for me to make my face look as good as it can be. I'm 61 years old and have been using this line for about 7 years. Depending on skin type and age I think some of their products work better than others. As with all their products a little goes a long way. The current price on Amazon is quite a bit lower than what I have to pay in a department store which is more than $200 for the same size jar!,5

This is the best glycolic acid lotion I have ever used. I have been using face acids on my face and neck for dark spots and wrinkles for many years. It feels great and it burns just a tiny bit. I thought nothing could actually make my face tingle and you only need to apply a dime size. I also<br />use a tiny amount with my eye cream. If you are not accustomed to using glycolic acid be careful with this brand. It is very potent. I suggest mixing a small amount with a moisterizer. I do that for my neck. A bit of redness and peeling is common. I will absolutely order again.,5
"This product was introduced to me by a local Beauty Spa. I just absolutely fall in love with the scent.<br />I usually place a dab or two behind my ear, use it like a perfume product.<br />This scent is so perfect pairing with my yoga practice.",5
"I had high hopes for this little baby, but after using for a few days, I must say it's just &#34;okay&#34;.  Perhaps it may be because when I bought it I had thick (or used to before my brush starting feasting on it) hair down to my butt and was tired of finding enough to knit my cat a sweater in my hair brush every morning.  So I wanted something that was more user friendly.  But then on an impulse I cut my naturally curly hair very short.<br /><br />The Pros:  It seems sturdy and well-made with a nice grain.  It's smooth (the teeth on the plastic picks tend to splinter and peel with time).  It feels comfortable to use.  It probably has good stay power.<br /><br />The Cons:  By far the biggest for me is that the teeth are spaced much more widely apart and are much thicker than I expected from the photo.  This means you can't really get the curl definition that the picks with a more narrow spacing will give you.  I also wish the handle were a bit longer.",3
"Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months.  I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.  Here's a good reference website:  [...]",1

"We purchased as a birthday gift, but did not come in time. Actually we should have ordered it at an earlier date.  So now we have put it up until Christmas of this year.  Will give it then.  It looks very nice and we are well pleased.",4
I was extremely happy to get this product. One is less expensive compared to others out there that claim to do the same. I am not sure if it made a difference. I do have to admit I stopped using it every night due to some crust appearing upon moring. I haven't completed stopped as I am still hopeful.,3
"I guess I just don't know how to use this. I put some on my hair in the shower and It did nothing. I used it with my shampoo and it felt like it dried my hair out even more so. I purchased this product because of dry hair, so I am confused about why it would make it drier? perhaps if someone has suggestions for me on how I should be using it to make my hair feel softer please I am all ears!",3
Im loving this night cream!<br />You're body heals while its sleeping/resting. This night cream works while you're sleeping and the results are very noticeable within a few days.,5
It does what it needs to do. Needed a comb in a shower to d’étranglé my hair and it does a great job doing that. Price was great. Definitely recommended it,5
as described.  thanks. LOVE!,5
"Wanted something that was gentler on my thinning, weaker hair than what I was using to prevent breakage.  It's a nice brush & works well.  As many said, the bristles are not long enough to go through all of the hair, but that really wasn't my goal, as I brush on top, then underneath, I just needed something gentler overall.  The wooden comb works well on my wet hair.",5
Beautiful soft hair ! ❤️,5
Thin lightweight well packaged for travel. Not drying of ur hands. Love it.,5
Great buy work great,5
"Gorgeous...cant wait to get some time to do my nails! FYI the center of the Rose is an unattractive open space that will most likely look best with a tiny diamond bling in it. I personally think that's a positive! Then again, it may not be noticeable once you get them on. UPDATE: I still think they are beautiful but there are a couple of issues. 1 they snag on everything! I am not a pro so I'm working on ways to gel them without making my nail real thick. 2. they bend real easy, again, completely encasing them in gel solves the issue but I'm not fond of the look. Nothing I would deduct stars for, just an FYI for the shopper.",5

"To the point,<br /> The wigs color was more copper than what I thought. That could have just be because in the pictures it does seem to have dark undertones but there are none.  26 inches I beg to differ, I think this wig was about a 22 inches. It had no weight to it. It was over processed and shed. the hairs coming off at the actual bulb part, where they stitch it on to the cap and it was so thin towards the bottom I'm guessing because it was over processed while being colored. I have never left a bad review but after spending almost 200 dollars I figured I'd at least give someone the heads up before they go in on this wig. Blonde colored wigs are more expensive, I understand because they have to dye them, but this one just lost the entire mark. and just FYI the wig cap is biigggggggg.....I will not be returning it. I'll cut my losses and stick to my normal brands.  I re-dyed it, re styled it and even cut it. I hate returning, so I will use it one of my, home wigs.  Very disappointed.",2
This does not last and smudges a lot,2
Qualiti for the price ok  shipping to high,3
Not a fan it’s not as floral fresh sent as I thought. Has a slight heavy scent. Many like it but won’t purchase again,3
This gives a smooth look to the face and covers under eye darkness too. I was surprised and pleased.  Will reorder this product,5

"I bought it to try out . It is a trial size so it's small and because of that it could be messy but it's expected .<br />I like the foundation ( it has 2 tones . One is fair and another is fair2 which is a bit darker then just fair so you can match it to your skin tone ) . But then I saw foundation for sale separately it contains some chemicals which doesn't sound like it's &#34; all natural &#34; so I wonder if this sample is natural also .<br />The eyeshadows would last long time . Especially some colors :-)<br />So overall I like the foundation but wonder about it's content . The rest of the set ( eyeshadows , blush and bronzer ) would last longer then foundation .<br />I think it worth to try it . It's not too expensive and you might like it .",4
My wife has used this for over a week.  Verdict.  Too oily.  She will not use it again.,2
"For the past 4 years, I was using an expensive Braun dry shaver and not getting a close shave. Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.",4
If you use this body scrub after you use soap it leaves a nice layer of moisture on your skin. I mostly feel the silica and rice powder when using this in the shower. It rinses nice and clean and leaves skin refreshed and renewed. This has lovely mango seed butter in it too. I used about a third of this tube in one full-body use. Think of it as a nice spa treatment!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,5
"Today I tried out Liquid Trust for the first time. I put some on before getting in the car with my husband. He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect. That is probably why salespeople use this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
"Goop Beauty's hand cream is soothing and deeply moisturizing. It absorbs quickly and leaves hands looking nourished and hydrated. The skin on your hand will almost look a little plump, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I had high expectations for this cream after trying the lip balm and I was not disappointed. The tube is fairly small, but perfect for a purse or pocket. I have my tube on my bedside table for use before bed. This is one of the best hand creams you will ever use. The secret? Shea butter as one of the top ingredients. You may want to get more than one tube! With all the handwashing we've all done in the past two years it is nice to have a cream that is protective and healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
"If you are looking for Harvest themed movies the first two in this collection are perfect. Harvest Love is about a woman who find herself again when she goes home for a vacation. The love story has the usual conflict at the start but the characters fall in love slowly and with a lot of restraint. No kissing until right at the end! Made me want to try pear desserts. Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can't be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don't mind when characters don't like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...""Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?"" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",4
"I keep a bottle of this lotion in three rooms of my house because I love it that much. I have one in the bathroom on the counter, one in the kitchen and one on my bedside table. That way any time I need a hand cream this is available. I also use this as a body lotion. This is the one Zum fragranced cream that smells the best to me and the scent dissipates quickly after use. To be honest my hands look ten years younger when using this particular lotion. There are a lot of essential oils in it so I think it is antiaging. I also love the particular scent of the Bulgarian lavender.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
"Are you looking for the ultimate in squeaky clean skin? This citrus-based mask cleanses pores like a dream, removing oil and dirt while softening skin too. You will need to moisturize after using this as your skin will feel a little tighter and drier. If you have oily problem skin, this will impress. Leave it on 8 minutes for the best effect. The texture of this mask is a little like firm whipping cream instead of clay. It is easy to apply and remove with a little extra care. You will immediately notice how absolutely purified your pores look. Impressive!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
If your hair takes a lot of abuse with heated drying and hot styling tools this fine mist creates a glistening moisturizing shine on your hair. I've been finding out lately how the hemp plant can make you more beautiful and even lose weight and cause your skin to be clear. This hair shine product is the icing on the cake of your hemp expenditures.<br /><br />The scent of this oil is very mild and pleasant. The oil is such a fine mist that it does not weight down the hair and seems to absorb well leaving a glossy shine. I saw this product a while ago and finally purchased some for myself! It will impress you with its natural ingredients and beautifying effects. I love it and I think after doing research around you will find this is the best shine product.<br /><br />This ships in a plastic bag but I did not find it leaking at all! Happy about that!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,5
"Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo has the wonderful fresh scent of an apple orchard. It is moisturizing like a cream shampoo and in combination with the conditioner these products smooth, strengthen and gloss each strand.<br /><br />After the first use I could feel how my hair was thickening and getting stronger. But by the third use of both the shampoo and the conditioner I could really tell a difference.<br /><br />I love the scent and how it makes my hair endure styling, blow drying and straightening. Your hair will be shinier too. I love these products as much as LUSH shampoos and conditioners and that is saying a lot!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
I enjoy using Zum Bar Goat Milk Soaps and this one is no exception. It is very nicely scented and has a slight exfoliating action due to what appears to be bits of seaweed in the soap. I can't guess what the essential oils are in this soap but they are heavenly. I noticed the scent of this soap is very calming. Love it!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,5
"As a fan of the philosophy lip glosses I used to use the vanilla cake one which I miss not being able to purchase on its own these days. So this is my second favorite and it is nice and sparkly, mildly flavored, not overly sweet and definitely not sticky. What is not to love?<br /><br />I use a lip balm first, apply a lipstick and then put this on top to hold the look together. It lasts quite a while or until you eat something, then you need to reapply. But I put this on before I go out and it lasts for hours. So I hope this flavor is going to be around for a while. :) I will admit that sometimes I even wear this one to bed! Love, love love!!!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It is man sized and will last a long time. He is using it now in the winter but I hear it is heat stable in the summer as well so he can leave it in the car. This tube is about three times the size of Burt's Bees lip balm. So if you want to make a man in your life happy this is the thing to buy. Chapped lips are no fun. This solves a big problem year round and is minty fresh too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,5
"If you are looking for something to make your skin look super healthy, toned and vibrant this is a good option if you are used to using serums. I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.<br /><br />The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it. The results are great (including smaller pores!) and I'm happy I tried this product. It is a time saver since I don't have to blend my own oils.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes.",5
"If you live in a dry climate you will especially love this moisturizing, calming mask. It goes on like a gel and cools the skin while it refreshes your complexion. I can't say enough good things about this mask. I have sensitive skin and it calms redness and irritation completely. The truth is you will want to use this every day. I put the mask on at night before bedtime and leave it on for ten minutes. Once washed off my skin is baby soft and plumper. Hours later it still feels like my face is cool and comforted. It especially helped to calm my skin down after I used a serum with retinol in it. So this is something I will want on hand at all times as it is very healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
"Does dry weather get you down because your hands feel uncomfortable and dry? Welcome to the experience of J.R. Watkins hand creams. I've tried nearly every scent and love them all. I have a lavender one I love using at night. This one is great for daytime as it is floral scented. You really don't need a lot so it lasts a lot longer than other less rich hand creams. This one is super moisturizing with luxurious shea butter, apricot kernel oil, coconut oil, aloe leaf juice and safflower seed oil. It also has a calming flower extract. So your hands get pampered to the max. I've pretty much stopped buying other hand creams and just reach for this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
I have never purchased pure cocoa butter before but I needed some for making some body butter. I found it very difficult to get this butter out of the container. I managed to get half a cup out with a dessert spoon. I can't see how anyone could use this on a regular basis. I'd only recommend it for making natural recipes. It has a very strong scent of chocolate.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,3
I recently made myself a body butter and used this oil in place of the almond oil the recipe called for. It worked really well. I will say however that this one bottle seems to be 125 ml as it filled up a half a cup. Using this in the body butter made the butter very luxurious. I now use it nightly on my hands and feet. You could also use this as a massage oil. I'm finding this really does make my skin look younger. After about a week you may notice a difference too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.,5
Why pay tons of money for a French manicure when it is so easy to do at home on your own schedule? I recommend the O3 color set as the pink color is very natural. You may want to use tip guides or you can just wing it. I didn't use tip guides and it came out great. Having a French manicure makes you look so elegant. I also found that the pink nail polish looks great on your toes.

"Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.<br /><br />The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.<br /><br />While many may see the color as ""Azure"" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.<br /><br />The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5

This is one of the few products with myrrh essential oil.<br /><br />Ingredients: Infusion of organic aloe vera extract, organic ginko biloba extract, organic elder extract, organic chamomile extract, caprylic/capric triglyceride, stearic acid, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, safflower oil, shea butter, mango butter, polysorbate 60, stearyl alcohol, sweet almond oil, tocopherol, beta carotene, rosehip seed oil, cucumber extract, green tea extract, algae extract, sodium carbomer, lavender essential oil, myrrh essential oil, neroli essential oil, vetiver essential oil, benzoin gum, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, propylparaben.<br /><br />Zia body butter is a rich moisturizing cream that absorbs fast and leaves your skin looking smooth and deeply moisturized.

If you use these three products and take a salt bath, then you may reach spa nirvana.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
"When I first tried this Marshmallow Vanishing Crème in a sampler kit, I purchased five more kits and then a 1.5 ounce glass container of this product. Can I say it is addictive? Yes, I guess it does have a banana scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whipped cream.<br /><br />To say this is decadent is an understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream. Fortunately, it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it ""vanishing"" crème. The ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax, grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract, willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady fragrance.<br /><br />Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.<br /><br />""Marsh Mallow"" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy.<br /><br />I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal. If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Crème on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind.<br /><br />I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel. They add a level of protection to your skin care routine and the clay mask I recently tried cleaned my pores like a dream.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br />A Total Burt Bees Fan Until the End of Time",5

You can hardly see the images! very poor quality and I suggest saving your money!,1
"I sent this as a gift and my mother said they were all so moisturizing, and not too heavy in the scents but lovely. She fell in love with the Gardenia so I scent her a larger bottle. I have ordered some of the different lotions myself and I have been very pleased with the quality of these lotions, you will not be disappointed.",5
Love the smell and does its job well.,5
"Product is great. Packing wasn’t great though and I opened a box to slimy plastic wrapped soaps that had leaked. Still, good product.",4
it's ok but too expensive.,4
Very nice,5
"Very nice (for us). The scent wafts out of the bathroom, into the bedroom and the hall. So we really enjoy the ritual of the scent. Thank you.",5
"What I love (and ALL the bar soaps I’ve ever purchased from this vendor has been wonderful) :<br />Oversized! It lasts a really LONG time ...no little slivers..it’s a great value!<br />Smells entirely wonderful...the scent wafts out of the bathroom ...into the hallway and makes the air I breath so beautiful (for both my husband AND myself). Makes for a good nights sleep.<br />Comes well packaged. Not shrink wrapped & difficult to access. The scent is nice so I like to stock up and have a drawer of them to scent our bathrooms until used.<br />I don’t know how they do this quality at this price...but it’s the best soap at the best price. Go get some, you’ll be happy too.",5
"I like big bars and I cannot lie.<br />This is rich, luxurious and long lasting.<br />It makes my skin smell good, feel good and as a bonus the whole bathroom smells good!",5
"This toothpaste is good. That said, I got what I paid for here. It’s not anything earth shattering, it won’t make your teeth any cleaner than another toothpaste, help your gums heal, etc. but it IS a healthier choice! For that I give it 4 thoughtful stars. Tastes good as well.",4
Used it in my golden retriever. Too oily.<br />Normally use coconut and it’s good for her (healthy) skin  and enjoys it.,2
"I like this stuff! It feels good on my lips. Gives a nice tint, too.",5
"Love these. Really great when you're stuck in a boring work meeting, and you can be all like, ""I wonder what color my nails are?"" In your head, and look down and BAM, different color. Boredom slightly reduced.<br /><br /> The dark purple and aqua is the coolest. Three colors really, dark purple, Cobalt blue, and light aqua. Blue to silver is more blue to light blue, but still cool.<br />Polish lasts for days if i prep my nails properly. Like most glitter polishes, they don't have a completely smooth finish without multiple coats of topcoat, but I don't mind.",5
This doesn’t work for me as well as the 3 day growth polish. I have tried it so many different ways on my bare nails and as a top coat and it does absolutely nothing. I noticed right away growth with the 3 day product but not this one.,1
"Well worth it you get a lot and they stay on long. Iam very happy with my purchase I had to wait a little for them to be delivered, but it was worth it.",5
"I love this product, the only downside is there is no mirror.  I gave 4 stars because no mirror.",4
Flimsy.  Not a very high quality,3
I never even opened these up because come to find out they are made in China and contain junky ingredients like parabens. No thanks. Returning.,1
"Sometimes I don't have time to wax or epilate, and remember something similar to this that my mum had when I was growing up. Did not disappoint!",5
"I had to change up my hair care because my old stuff started making my hair fall out so bad. i was sent to this brand on a recommendation from a hair stylist. i purged my hair twice, then finally got to use this in its glory, and it is nice. the scent is not strong, it is easy to wash and condition. goes on nice and comes out clean.",5
"I hate... and i mean HATE curling my hair...  My hair doesnt hold curl long, so the long tedious work of using curlers is not worth the effort for me. But i eally wanted to play with curls again, and thought these would be so cool! They are fun, and i will admit, at first sight i was confused, but then i totally got it, and they are easy! Nice curl result too!",5
I will buy it again.,5
These are so amazing tiny and cute,5
"Wipes are good, shampoo caps leave heavy feel in my hair.  Three stars.",3
"The metallic white has been my favorite and metallic pink and most of the blue hues--which is why I'm really ticked off  I use the metallic white A LOT more than the rest.  I'll have to buy more.  These won't chip with a good base and top coat (ALWAYS use a base and top coat), apply two coats of top coat, if needed, and always paint your free edge.",5
They are too wide for my eyes/ they are are NOT reusable-did not stick same way second time/ not happy with this  purchase,1
"I got these because my boy is growing his hair. These do not hold the hair back, do not act as a zigzag , nothing. They fit wrong so they poke. 4 people tried it and none liked it so it was just a waste of money. How sad.",1
I used the flat iron with it. I't natural hair and is tick.<br /><br />Utilicé la plancha de cabello con ella. Es pelo natural y es fuerte.,5
"Exactly what I wanted. Smells delightful, I cant wait to use it in my practices.",5
"The product is awesome, simple and beautiful, but it’s hard to stick in hair.",4
"I have had this bottle for over a year. I use it to dye my hair light(ish) pink. I mix it with my conditioner to keep it light and to keep my color up in between dying it. It’s perfect. Ask me questions if you need to! I will try to help. For my use, it lasts for a good two weeks without keeping up with it in my conditioner. If I keep it in my conditioner for daily use, I rarely have to sit and dye it for an hour. Love this brand.",5
"I really love these facial wipes.  The delicate scent is so nice, and they're a great way of removing every last bit of makeup, dry skin, sweat, etc. that may remain after washing.  They're also very refreshing on a warm day while you're getting ready for bed.  A little pricey but worth it.",5
"I use these to anchor my ponytail up against my head when I shower, exercise, or want my hair off of my neck. Whether I am actively exercising or laying down on my yoga mat, they hold my hair in place. I bought a set but loved them, so I ordered a 10 pack. I carry one in my yoga bag, my swim bag, my suitcase, and my purse. They seem very durable. I am happy with this purchase.",5
"Beautiful and fun, but not a very universal fit.. but I guess if you have a smaller head and a ton of hair you'll look great!",2
a little cheap looking,4
Took way longer to get here than expected.  I haven't used them yet and there was powder all over all the packages like one was open. The colors are nice.,4
Love the colors and the value.  These are thick and very pretty and they have an amazing effect.  I tested all the colors and all are vibrant and produce the cat eye effect easily with the provided magnet.  Lots of fun to use these.,5
Really happy with it. It's much cuter than the pictures made it look. Not too shiny either. Smaller inside which was nice cause there was no extra fabric making it odd shaped. Definitely recommend for cosplay.,5
They're perfect in every way....  Glad I brought them.,5
Very useful for my beauty serums,5
These are really different from regular tattoos..looks more like jewelry on your skin!!,5
The silver and gold look really good on tan skin.,5
These are really wicked cool and look hot! Although they look better on tanner skin.,5
Love these things..Nothing Permanent and sweet colors,5
"I really liked these. I had my hairdresser add them to my hair on my wedding day and she did a great job of incorporating them. Not too flashy/blingy and they added just the right amount of sparkle. For me, these were a better choice than some of the larger combs that I had considered.",4
I love this stuff - dries quickly and smells great.  Nice for the hands.,5
Love it,5
Wife loves this stuff.,5
"This is such a great hairbrush! My daughter like to use the small one! So does my son. Basically I hairbrush that gets your children to brush your hair is a winner for me. As a mom you'd know what I'm talking about.<br /> But for me I also like it. I really like the big one. I don't have a ton of hair but I have very wavy not very thick hair. The wooden bristles are kind of massaging on my scalp! Lol it's pretty nice.<br /><br /> I bought other products from the same company. Like recently I got these wooded toothbrushes, and I really like those as well they produce high-quality product.<br /><br /> In the health food store the other day I saw a very similar hairbrush made out of wood. Except it costed seven dollars more and it did not come with the travel brush… Which I didn't realize I would like so much.",5
I get lots of compliments! The front part of the wig had straight hair but I trimmed and gave it Bangs and I love it!  Great for the price!,5
"Nice salt and pepper color, not silver. I get lots of compliments. Great for the money.",5
Smells wonderful,5
"Loved the braid, but didn't come in the color I ordered.",3
"I love this hair balm - I used it all the time about a decade ago.  It creates a nice shine and has a lovely light fragrance to it.<br /><br />The biggest complaint that I have is the price this seller is selling this product for!  I believe this product is discontinued which could explain the price, but you can find this product other places for less than half the price!",3
I bought this in high hopes with the great reviews. I was incredibly disappointed. I followed the instructions (and reviews) exactly correct and it had no results. I wasn't happy with this product,1
When I'm ready to do my keratin treatment this silicone brush is what I'll be using. Thanks for such a cute brush!,5
"I expected a pile of crap, but I was pleasantly surprised, those are good quality.",5
"I foster disabled cats, and kittens, and sometimes puppies, and own quite a few pets as well. A sickly kitten accidently caused a flea outbreak, plus had a lot of flea dirt that was impossible to remove all of with just bathing. I used flea medicine, and then combed each animal thoroughly, and this is by far the best flea brush I ever used. I didn't use the big comb, because I only got it for the brush type one. Its sturdy, and removes even tiny bits of flea dirt. Highly reccomend this one",5
love it,4
"I use fractioned oils to make rollerballs for my oil blends and for a carrier for various topical uses.<br />I have been wanting to recreate a muscle cramp relief oil from a major essential oil club and lucked up with a copycat recipe.  These oils are over $30 for 5ml and, while it works great and smells amazing, I just couldn’t bring myself to spend that knowing that I have a box full of single oils.<br />When I saw this bottle with the pump, I knew it was time to try my hand and mixing this recipe.  I had a few other rollerballs that I wanted to make (some decongestant and immune boosters since it’s getting to that time of year) so I inserted the pump and got to work.  The oils mixed VERY well and the pump on the bottle made it very easy to dispense just enough into the small rollerball opening.  That is SUCH a nice feature – manufacturer, please don’t remove that from the item.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spilled my fractioned oil everywhere because it was difficult to contain since it’s thin.<br />Once I had worked through the 5 rollerballs for my family needs, I had enough room in the bottle to make a BIG batch of the massage oil with the rest of the fractioned oil.  IT WORKED!!!  I’m soooooo happy with this bottle of fractioned oil.  I can easily pump out what I need to work out my sore muscles and apply to hubby’s back (he has scholosis and other degenerative issues).  I would highly recommend for anyone wanting to use fractioned oil for their essential oil uses.<br />I have opted to test products as a hobby and thus, received this product at a reduced price in order to fully test the product offered. I have not been paid to leave a review but simply received a discount to test the product for flaws or issues.  This review is of my own words and using my firsthand experience with the product. If I like it, I like it, if I don’t, that is reflected in my reviews.  I have written this review as if I paid full price for the product and is not biased due to the discount. If you appreciated my review, please click “yes”, that it was helpful",5
"I am not a fan of petroleum jelly which this kind of is similar just not as oily or greasy.  This works well for extremely dry skin, eczema and skin rashes to soothe and moisten the areas.  It is also could for minor burns that sometimes happens when you're a patient of radiation and chemo therapy. I have seen that work fairly well.",5
Made my daughters hair super shiny,5
My hair looks awesome.<br />Love me son tresemme,5
"Easy to make buns, for thick OR thin hair",5
great seeds smell very well and arrived quickly.,5
I'm always trying something different so I love this color!!,5
Received a lot of compliments. It does mat up in the back but it was worth the price for me.,5
Nice,5
Love it,5
Good stencils but not really reusable,4
"Changed my life!  My eyes felt so heavy and dry, tired, junked up (not visibly so), every morning. I’ve been using this for 5 days, 3-4 times a day, and my eyes feel so good afterwards. I guess I didn’t know how bad my eyes had gotten over the years. My eye doctor has prescribed all kinds of expensive drops for allergies, inflammation, dry eyes, scratched corneas, etc. This has done more in 5 days than anything else. I’m not sure why this wasn’t considered by my doctor long ago. Kinda upsetting, but I’m glad I found it eventually on my own.<br />BE CAREFUL, it can burn your eyes if gotten inside. I scrub each eye separately with cotton pad. I have a wet rag ready to wipe off excess. Repeat with a new cotton pad to the other eye. If you do both at the same time, you might lose the washcloth because you can’t open your eyes before rinsing. The price was attractive enough to not try and make it myself. I’m surprised that people are willing to pay quadruple for the exact same ingredients, which frankly could be made at home.",5
"I ordered your product after trying multiple, including KISS and the expensive ""magnetic"" eyelashes.  Your product is no comparison they are the best!  I was spending $$ every 2-3 weeks on extensions. These are the closest I've gotten to looking natural. Love them!  Note - I was not compensated to leave this comment like other sellers. This is my own personal opinion.",5
Very dark and small 4 oz.  Discovered bottom of bottle cracked,2
This slips like crazy! The fabric is a lycra type and simply slides off.,1
I don't like smell of this one. It does seem to moisturize well.  Am using it as hand soap vs returning it. I like the smell of the lavender one the most.,3
"I just installed these last night. I wanted to cover up some intense layering that I think makes my hair look frizzy when straight. Was initially pleased with the color and quality but the tape is not very strong. Now I'm realizing after styling that not only is the tape bad, but the hair is sketchy. Some of the sandwiches are already pulling apart and do not feel sticky. The hair itself smelled slightly synthetic while I styled it, and I noticed the ends bubbled up with heat application like synthetic would. I also noticed several strands of super thick, plastic-feeling pieces. I pulled one off the weft and it snapped apart like it was plastic. Tried to take a picture of the bubbled ends as well as one of the thick pieces.<br /><br />I've used other inexpensive brands that have had better tape, and don't mind synthetic when you know it's what you'll get. I will probably take these out and return them as-is or have to buy better tape to fix them.",2
"Tiny little bottles, but they go a long way.<br /><br />Scent is top notch",5
The plastic is ridged and gets stuck in hair.  I like the two sizes of loopdie-loos  but the rubber bands get stuck the little slicer tool cuts the hair and don't even try to use the french breading tool on thin hair,3
Got one and dont want to return it but its pretty glitchy. Lights go on and off when turning it and has to be positioned just right to work. Other than that it would have been EXCELLENT. Hopefully this is not a common problem.,3
"Color is not natural black. More of a #2 or dark brown. Had to return. Came very well packaged, felt soft, not tangled, and the texture was 3a-c.",4
Better than the garbage bag I used when I last cut my husband's hair for him! I like this product.,4
"Good stuff. Nice amount too. Use at night, patting around dark circles under eyes for some noticeable relief. By the way, the ceremide is NOT even among the first several ingredients, so the title here is misleading...",4
"Nice scent, subtle, and it works!",5
"I have long thick hair that knots easily and I am amazed at how well this brush is at detangled the most matted hair without causing pain or excessive hair loss. You would think I haven't brushed my hair in a year, but it is like this every morning.<br /><br />The difference is breathtaking after using it on dry hair, and I was amazed to see how much less hair loss there was on wet hair after shampooing and conditioning.<br /><br />I wish I had discovered this brush months ago and I would give them 10 stars if I could!.<br /><br />This brushwork all hair types and I highly recommend them",5
"This high HA formulation has a lot of great ingredients, and visibly reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles with the first use.<br /><br />As a woman of a certain age, I am thrilled to find an effective and reasonably priced product that leaves my complexion 'naturally' soft, smooth and hydrated without leaving a slimy, or shiny silicone type residue.<br /><br />Too many beauty serums  tend to over promise, and under deliver in addition to being way overpriced., so  I am delighted to find a reasonably priced product that exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this one!",5
"I loved the super-thin brush to create an ultra-fine line. but it's not enough to keep the entire lash attached. Even the smallest ones are too large and applying several coats just results in a thick, messy tacky line. I have hooded lids and it transferred the upper lid in the blink of an eye.  The eyeliner itself is nearly impossible to remove. I applied it on my hand and had to use a stiff scrub brush in order to remove it.<br />I tried a few sets of magnetic lashes and only one performed fairly well, but this wasn't one of them.",1
"The black bands are very wide and perhaps triple the width of bands Ii have purchased preciously, which I like. It's interesting that there is such a contrast in thickness between the black and colored bands. Perhaps the colorful bands are meant for children's hair. They are well packaged in zippered plastic bags.",4
"I tried two 4D Silk mascaras by this brand on each eye for comparison and the CPCP Real Eyes Long Fiber Eyelash Mascara offers excellent lash separation. The thin comb bristle brush is great for separation, especially on the lower lashes.  I've worn both for 36 hours and after massive eye rubbing, I am surprised at how fresh it looks. I awoke with no raccoon eyes and no need to reapply it today. it didn't flake off! This is truly a long-lasting mascara.<br /><br />**  If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **",4
"Out of all the 4D Silk Mascaraas I've tried recently the CPCP Elegant Princess Long Fiber Eyelash Mascara is one of my favorites. The packaging is gorgeous and the brush is a thicker comb-like bristle, which is great for volume and definition. My lashes looked dramatically darker and fuller and I really noticed the difference when I went outside and checked it out in my rearview mirror. I had tested two mascaras on each eye and this one really stood out. I have been wearing it for almost 36 hours and even slept in it.  After rubbing my eyes since the last night, the top lashes held and I didn't wake up with raccoon eyes. however, it does flake a bit. It applied smoothly and since It's not a quick drying mascara so you have a bit of time to tease out the lashes to avoid  any clumping..",4
"Lately, I have become enamored with hair building fibers for both root and scalp coverage. The results have been amazing, and many of the products I have used contain Keratin or Gossypium as the primary ingredient. The Toppik Hair Building Fibers contains 99% Keratin, but the fibers were larger and coarser than others and did not blend or adhere as well. It wasn't the natural-looking coverage I had come to expect. Just goes to show they're not all the same.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **",3
"I have finally found the perfect flat iron for my bangs.  The Milantia Mini Hair Straightener 3/4"" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron heats up fast to take care of my half curly bangs that have a mind of their own.<br /><br /> I have coarse thick hair, but my bangs have thinned with age and have started developing weird curls and cowlicks. It's the only part of my hair that needs the nuclear option because I keep the rest of it braised most of the time.<br /><br />I don't have time for a lot of hair care, and this little flat iron heats up fast and does exactly what I need it to do. It's small, lightweight,  nimble, and exactly what I have been looking for!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

"Even though I am not fond of the paper masks (prefer collagen), there is no denying they work well and my aging skin feels replenished, hydrated and rejuvenated. I have very sensitive skin due to seborrheic dermatitis, so I have to be very careful with skincare products. Why do I always feel the need to test them on Sunday when I have work the next day? No worries, my skin will look great and If I can find the time I may do another treatment in the morning to give my skin a little more radiance. There is no denying the results.<br /><br />Pro Tip: They work even better when you put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before use. It will help tighten the pores up and feels extra refreshing!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

"Okay, I am a fan but with caveats. I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great. Gals with thicker brows will reap the most benefit b using the mascara type brush for the most natural look and pigment distribution.",4
"I'm so sad to give this product one star.  I purchased this after seeing the craze on social media and had to try it.  The day I arrived I gave it a try and absolutely loved the result, I felt like my face was flawlessly covered, not cakey, and that I was able to use less foundation than I was used to. The next day, I went to try it again and realized that the outer layer of the silicone applicator had peeled off on the back.  The inside of the applicator is very sticky, so that rendered that one useless.  I figured it was a dud and tried the next one, The same exact thing happened! I was using very light pressure and rinsed with water after each use. Additionally, my foundation is made for sensitive skin and is very eco friendly. so I know that there is no way that the foundation eroded the applicator. Needless to say, I am very disappointed, these things are awesome until they're not.",1
Great deal,5
Meh....... okay I guess.,5
"Great cotton. Tip: don't open the box. Cut a hole in the sealed box just big enough for your thumb and forfinger to reach in. This way, it despences sort of like a Kleenex box.",5
I cannot believe that I am this excited for a mister!!!,5
"Love these little pots of lip exfoliating joy.  Easy to use and wipe off. Dead skin on lips just slides off.  Don’t particularly like the vanilla flavor, overly sweet but the others are fine. Would reorder.",5
Doesn’t work good like the original Nail Aid foot exfoliating product. New gel like formula is more like a cleaning gel. Very disappointed.,1
"Bought as a gift.... not drinking the coffee, so no solid review here.",4
"EDIT:  These SIX have lasted me almost 8 months.  Now, how long they last for someone depends on use, but really for the price and how much a manicure costs....great deal.<br /><br />I keep my nails filed short and push back cuticles after washing my hands and just use a good hand lotion on my hands and cuticles....AND USE THESE BUFFERS!<br /><br />I love my hands and nails always look well-groomed and I can literally shine them up in minutes.  ALSO as one gets older, ridges, dullness more common and these get rid of BOTH!<br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br />I have tried MANY of these type file/buffers.  I go through them fast.  I like a clean, buffed nail as I no longer use polish.<br /><br />THIS one is one of the better ones and to get SIX for about 10.00 is GREAT.<br /><br />it has SEVEN sides, one is fine grit to smooth edges of nail.<br /><br />Does a great job.  SMOOTHS and SHINES beautifully.<br /><br />I would definitely reorder.",5
I used both of the colors together n they look amazimg!,5
It's perfect for a child's head but too tight for an adults. Great idea but no stretch or give which induces a headache.,3
"I love how easy it is to apply, the variety of colors to choose from, and the quality and value of this product.",5
Works well in the heating pillows that I make.,5
Works Great.  Just what we needed,5
I love these faux locks! I’ve bought them 4 times. This is my second time using this set.,5
I love Stilla products. My order was delivered quickly and the makeup feels very light. I like it and would recommend.,5
"This products works magic I swear! I love this product for taking down scarring color & scars, also helps with hair growth just dont use to much as your hair will be extremely greasy ( dont use alone for hair growth) would recommend this product.<br />Came in a decent size package so no damage done.<br />Arrived in timely matter with Amazon primr",5
Kids like them a little big but will grow into,5
Doesn't dissolve as well as other clays,2
"I bought this to try as I love a good scrub, especially a good sugar scrub. However, this is sticky and expires fairly quickly or at least the one I received expired with in 3 months. It is sticky and I just didn't like it as a face scrub so I used it as a body scrub. Since the packaging is quite small using it as a body scrub does not go a long way. I know that this scrub is raved about and has great reviews, but it just didn't work out for me.",2
Great product I highly recommend the stainless steel roller to plastic you can see results better and it stays colder longer !  Easy to maintain as well 😀,5
Not as good as quality wipes like pampers<br />These are smaller and dryer,2
Not a good fit,3
Looked old and dirty,1
Lays down those edges and thickens hai. Not too greasy,5
It came out of shape like other reviews. I asked for a replacement so we shall see and update my review.,3
Was able to do both daughter’s hair,5
"Didnt have time to post a photo, maybe later. LOL<br /><br />So, I have been waiting to wash the hair until I posted a review. Had the hair installed on Nov. 6th, washed it this morning in the shower, used my regular shampoo and conditioner, sprayed a leave in conditioner in and used a big comb, and wig brush, added a little coconut oil, hair is beautiful and shiny. If time permits I will submit a photo later.",5
I’m no makeup artist so the easier it is to highlight and contour is better for me ! I bought this just to try it . The price is great and turns out I actually love the way it works . So easy to apply and lasts a while . I use it just about every day and I’ve had it for a few months now . Very creamy but doesn’t make you feel like your face is suffocating,5
"Only been using this product for a few days & already see results !!!! I'm in love. I had a beautiful baby boy 7 months ago and since then anything I tried for the stretch marks didn't work. I will be buying this once mine runs out. Has such a great smell and apply easily, doesn't make you feel sticky or slimy. Love!!!",5
I used the curler with mascara and got pretty nice long effect results. Not much thickness but definitely saw a nice difference in my lashes. I got alot of compliments on my first day I tried it.<br />Easy to apply and stays on all day. Still looked good in the late afternoon as I did in the morning.,5
Love this oil!,5
Works like a charm to prevent razor burn. Lasts for months and months if you keep it dry after each use. Highly recommended,5
I love Squid ink but can’t find It in the big tub size anymore☹️ Not really worth the price but so I use It sparingly,4
Smell does not last,1
"I am a very fair skinned Irish woman so the sun does not agree with me.  I'll admit there are times when you are going out and the outfit that you choose would look great with some color to your skin.  Well, that is why I purchased this self tanning lotion and thought I would give it a try.  We are now in the winter months in New England so I chose to test this product on my mid section and abdomen where it would not show if this was a flop!<br />Much to my surprise I now have a bronze belly!<br />The lotion is a good size bottle of 8.5 ounces and is a very army green color when dispensed.  Be sure to wear a disposable glove when applying or yes, your palms will turn bronzed.<br />I applied this sparingly as the directions stated and waited two hours and I am impressed with the color and that there is no streaking.  I have since showered several times and reapplied and the results are great.  I am very anxious to be able to do this in the warmer weather and have a good looking tan for the first time in years.",5
Hair for hairdresser,5
great top coat !!! really protects my nail polish in addition to making it dry almost instantly !,5
Nice gift for Angel tree,5
love it,5
Not sure how many layers were put on in that picture but doesn't really show up on my skin.,2
"Nails are harder, less likely to break.",5
Fresh and light/seems to hydrate well,3
Good product but not fog resistant at all.,3
love it,4
"Edited: After using these for a couple of months I realize that they are too small. If I use a very low profile hair clip to put my hair up my hair will fit. If I use a larger alligator clip I can I get all my hair in there. All the bits around the edges will hang out. They’re just too small. 7/18<br /><br />These are great. I have long hair and put my hair up in a clip under the shower cap. Depending on where I put the clip and what size it is, the cap can be a little tight or can fit perfectly. I would say make sure you use a low profile hair clip. And it’s also longer In one direction than the other, so you might have to turn it if you find it isn’t covering well. But it covers just fine for me and I’m glad I bought them.",3
"Came in super fast! Love the product! Great quality too, not the cheap sets!",5
"I originally purchased this eyeliner at a Kohls department store for my daughter for her to practice with makeup. However, I ran out of my regular eyeliner one day and I had to use I had to use hers. It was soooo AMAZING that I immediately went to Amazon to see if they had and to my pleasant surprise, they did.<br /><br />It glides on with ease, its true to color and doesn't lighten after application. Its EXTREMELY precise and beyond easy to use. It is by far genuinely the EASIEST liquid eyeliner I have used in my 25plus years of using liquid liners. The felt tip is more hardened which makes its SUPER easy to control and place on the eyelid, whereas other liquid liners have softer felt tips which are floppy and they bend easy leaving you with having to press lightly so you don't mess up your straight line. This E.L.F liner is opposite of ALL that, its hard but not TOO hard that it doesn't glide precisely with your stroke. It has a PERFECT sized super thin tip which allows me to give my cat eye a precise small line finish at the corner of eye, it's perfection!<br /><br />My most FAVORITE part of this liquid eyeliner is that it does NOT get cakey, if I want a thicker more pronounced look, I can go over the same line several times and it doesn't cake up. I mean sure if you're gonna put 10 layers on, I'm sure it'll eventually cake, but building  with 3 layers, no cake! First time I tried to do thicker line, I was so nervous not wanting to mess up my entire eye makeup, but I had faith and gave it a try and was SHOCKED that it didn't get thick and cakey, and it still looked like I only had 1 layer of eyeliner on.<br /><br />Did I mention it stays put! I'll sometimes get watery eyes in the corner of my eyes, and this magic liner doesn't smudge, doesn't rub off, it could be that my make up setting spray helps, or it could be the eyeliner, but whatever it is its definitely some sort of sorcery. Haha.... But regardless with the insanely affordable price, you WON'T be disappointed!!!<br /><br />It removes SUPER easy with make up remover, or just soap and water, I always wash my face, then use make up remover to get any remaining make up off, and the eyeliner always seems to be gone after just soap and water.<br /><br />Truly the best bang for your buck!!!!",5
"I have tried many face products over the years but nothing has seemed to work. My skin isnt awful, but at 40 years old I feel like I should be done with the occasional breakouts. This cleaner is wonderful. Smells amazing. Bubbles nice on my face and I can feel a slight tingle as it works. Washing it off my feels fresh, clean, and without the tightness or hard feel of other cleaners. Most importantly my face looks great<br /><br />Update 11/2018<br />It has been awhile and I just want to say WOW... I am still using nightly and my face has never looked so good.  Even my husband has mentioned to me how ""fresh"" my face looks. I lather it in and I can feel tingly fresh feeling bubbles. The smell is to DIE FOR.  I honestly think also that this has helped with some fine lines and wrinkles... This maybe the answer ladies (and gentleman) to your skin needs",5
I have had this for awhile now and couldn't happier. I lovethe adjustable settingsand attachments. The dryer Is amazing quality. The cord is thick and not easily knoted.,5
Good price for 4 packs. But I would like to see better quality for this price. Sometimes it feels like a little rough. The rounds are too thin and you’ll need to use more. I think it’s not worth it because you can buy more expensive one and you’ll use it same time like this one.,2
I love the results and the feel,5
Awesome,5
ok,5
"Just as pictured, kids loved them",5
Didnt work like I was hoping it would of.,2
"I like the lace front wig, it's a great summer Wig. I brought the color 1B, it gives it a nice sleek look. One side of the lace front wig is a little longer then the other side. So this is an Asymmetry cut bob, I didnt not realize that at first. I like my bobs cut even around. Other than that I like the style of the lace front wig. I may buy it again in the color TT6/23, thats mine flavor blonde color mix.",5
"Not for my type of hair & scalp. I have curvy, thin, low porosity, bleach damaged hair & most moisturizing conditioners leave a heavy build up on my scalp & make my hair limp. That is exactly what happened with this mask too. The scent is light & kind of melon smelling & it spreads easily, but other than those 2 things, I did not like it.",2
Almost 2/3 had holes & the elastic was torn or unraveled. Would not recommend or repurchase. Better quality from a plastic bag,1
This oil is wonderful. Nice light scent. Faint pineapple almost. I add a little to my lotion & apply or massage into tired muscles. Makes shaved legs feel wonderful & works great for dry winter skin. Lasts a long time.,5
"My husband really likes the handle and the blades.  Told me at 68 and a tough beard, it was the best shave ever.",5
this smells amazing and this doesnt leave a greasy feel. Moisturizes great.,5
Smells so good that it almost made me wants some of these desserts!,5
"These clear nail tip arrived very fast, they look very strong and sturdy.",5
"Use any polish, buy Pretty Diva No Wipe UV led Gel, once polish is dry apply the Gel, place in UV nail machine for about a minute.<br />Your Gel will be firm but not totally set, use the eye shadow tool and dip in the holographic powder and lightly cover and then still lightly rubbing in a circle until you are happy with effect.<br />Use your free hand and lightly rub in andvoff the excess powder.<br />Then apply one more coat of Gel, place nails in the UV machine for about 3 minutes and you will have nails so pretty!!<br />Lots of complements, the effect is more pronounced with dark colors.  Black is very pretty as well as Dark Blues ect.",5
great,5
These lip liners did not stay on. They did not show on my lips well. You could not sharpen them and they were very hard to turn. Some wouldn't turn at all so they were useless once you used the point that was there,2
"Don't waste your money they don't stay in place,they slide up at the slightest movement.",1
"My son loves these, the smells are fruity and not to strong and they are super cute.",5
I like everything about it accept that the shampoo was really watery; it's like someone watered it down.. I can't imagine that it would come that runny. the conditioner is normal thickness.,4
"This brush seems small for a sz. 8, but aside from that, it’s a great brush for the price!",5
"My son had very sweaty feet, and this product really worked well and made him feel more confident.",5
"Excellent sprayer, delivers a heavy mist. I use one to mist my baby sequoia trees and they are very happy about it, lol.",5
"I had one that took 2 AA batteries and it worked well, but the batteries had to be replaced too often. So when I saw this one with usb charge, I bought it. It was double the price but in the long run it will be worth it,because I don't have to change batteries. It works great and the charge lasts a long time. My lashes stay curled all day.<br />UPDATE: Still good but does not stay charged for long. I have to charge every other day.",5
"How have I never seen one of these????????These are the easiest, most comfortable combs I have ever used.  So easy to put in and they stay all day.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and this really stays put without having to be adjusted all the time.",5
"They came really fast.  They are really cute, and the most comfortable headbands I've ever worn.  They stay on all day.  The variety of colors is also nice.  I would buy again.",5
"First off, the wig is definitely not like the picture advertised. Its not full and definitely not a full 16 inches.  But it doesn't shed and the hair is soft and light weight. Other than that I have no real complaints about it. As someone who is recovering from chemo, this wig makes me feel a little more confident for the time being.<br /><br />****<br />I have to give an update to this order. After my honest review of the product,  the seller was actually kind enough to reach out to me and offer me secondary choices in order to better accommodate my dissatisfaction of my wig. I am beyond pleased with the professionalism and great customer service of this particular company. Im changing my review to 5 stars simply based off the fact that they are so eager to please their customers.<br />Thank you",5
Great replacement for my prior purchases,5
"Quite big , needs to be much smaller . Not comfortable at all.",3
Great product and quick delivery.,5
Luv it,5
Use for making homemade creams.,5
Okay.,4
Great for removing calluses. Saves me from having to get pedicures. The recharging is good because I don't have to replace batteries.,5
great brush for curly hair,5
"Just okay fit, needs to be styled but blends nicely with hair coming back from Chemo",3
This pen is easy to use and does not cause sensitivity. Whitens teeth easily.,5
Only heardheats  up to 250 degrees,1
"My hair is black with gray throughout. When I went into Sephora to try this product, the rep used #3 which was way too dark. Foolishly, I bought it and wasn't satisfied with the color but I love the product. I ended up buying #2 at a later date and it's okay but still on the darker side. I found this #1 on Amazon for a lot less expensive  so I decided to give it a try. What's funny is that this is meant for blondes but it works fine with my dark hair. I like a more natural look rather than bold, so this works great.",5
"I love this hairspray! I don't like &#34;products&#34; in my hair, like gels, etc. However, this spray holds the style and even when my short hair is brushed, the style/curl retains the style. Great product and good price.",5
I now do my own gel dipping powder nails and this nail drill makes all the difference with this process. It's easy to use and has multiple drill bits that make the job easier. Such a great tool!,5
"when my daughter and granddaughter come over, they take what I have sitting out. That means my supply of scrunchies diminish and have to be replenished. These may not be able to make two twists for thick hair, but for thin, it will. Maybe even three.",5
I just put this on and it was creamy and a small amount can go a long way. I even put some on the outer eye wrinkles and the labial lines. I can feel the tightening as I type.,5
"they are not fragrance free though. As know, essential oils have fragrances to them and you can smell the oils in these two bottles. What is bad, is that they both leaked, even though they had plastic covering the tops and on the upper parts of the bottle. They were shipped in a shipper bag with the poly bubble interior and that was not enough protection.",3
"This will help your skin heal quicker and better than just using regular facial products. OxygenCeuticals makes a fine product that is designed to moisturize, calm and repair skin. You will love it after you start using it.",5
"This helps so much. I have eczema, psoriasis and who knows whatever else and I am always having to treat somewhere. This will help with the cracked skin.",5
"You don't have to use conditioners afterwards. And your scalp feels better. If you have dandruff or eczema, this will most likely help both of those issues. The smell is sweet but tolerable and doesn't last all day. This one you use after you have shampooed your hair and you leave it in 5 minutes. My hair still had tangles though.",4
"This kit comes with about everything that is needed. It is packed with 1 tattoo machine pen,1 tattoo power supply,1 tattoo foot pedal, 7pcs tattoo ink, 40pcs tattoo cartridges needles, 1 tattoo grip tape,100pcs tattoo ink cap cups, 1  tattoo transfer paper and 1pcs tattoo kit case. Everything comes packed in the case.",5
"I have decided silk is a wonderful thing. It keeps your hair nice as you sleep and it makes a great, gentle exfoliator that I can use without scratching up my dry legs and arms. I would recommend everyone try this.",5
"and a nose that doesn't get over fragranced easily, this is your cream. It is thick, applies easily and gets absorbed quickly.

It takes a small squeeze of product and I can apply it all over my face and my neck area. You can feel the moisture immediately.,5
"Unfortunately, you just can judge how a shade will look on your skin until you can see the foundation against your skin. That is the reason I have been having to get more than just two shades at a time. This product comes with two different shades, but they are for people lighter than me and I am pretty pale.",4
"Instead, I would say it is foundation. I like that it has sunscreen in it. It also comes with an extra bottle of foundation and two sponges for application. Last night, after this came in, I tried some of the color on my hand. I am old so I have age spots. None were covered. But that is okay. I also discovered I should have gone a shade darker.",4
"I have seen many kits that do not include ink. Buy your own ink because the ones that have had ink are small containers. So, instead of gigging it for not having ink, review it on its performance and all that comes with it. Most beginners learn either from a tattoo artist, or from a course. There are even videos available on the internet to help you learn some things. This kit comes with 1 PC tattoo pen machine, 1 PC cable, 1 tattoo power supply and power cord, 20 tattoo needles/box, 2 bandages, 100 mixed size tattoo ink caps, 1 pedal Plate (without ink) and a piece of practice skin.",5
This type of halo is fashioned to be secured in place with the clips. You will most likely require someone to help you the first time. Make sure to follow all directions for care so that the hair will last longer and not tangle as easy.,5
"The girl has gotten into wearing wigs. She even names them. She has a few and she makes tic toc videos to show them. Yes, she is a weird young teen. She also does up her face and nails and she does a great job. She is going to love the lavender one and the ombre one. Heck, she may even love the black one. I like that one.",5
"Burt's Bees is great for babies, children and adults. It is a nice kit and it is filled with:  Ultra gentle lotion, bubble bath, foaming shampoo and wash, nourishing baby oil, and face and Hand cloths. This can be used on anyone.",5
"This travel set has an activating exfoliating cleanser and mask, a bottle of toning goodness, eye serum and a whipped moisturizer. This is what I am taking on vacation with me. I do not like packing up a lot of products that are full sized. This is great for me and my skin.",5
"This kit has a foundation that is liquid, a wooden handled short brush, a bottle of pore invisible facial primer and tops it off with a container of CC cream.",5
"This kit includes 7 sponges with different sizes, two bottles of foundation (that way you can custom blend the foundation color that will more closely match your skin). You also get a brush, if that is what you prefer to use to apply foundation. Finally, you get a small bottle of all matte pore invisible primer.",5
"Starting the treatment today also. I will use it and hopefully see results. This tool kind of resurfaces your skin and the heat helps to produce collagen. I will give it time and if it doesn't do anything, I will update",5
"Cucumber and aloe gives you such a refreshing smell. That smell can also make you feel better, The body wash is easy to use and after you lather up, you rinse. It leaves your skin moisturized.",5
"I have been known to use them on my skin and on my hair. I am a woman, but I love this scent. I burn incense with a similar scent. For my hair, I let the balm sit in my palm until it melts it enough to be liquid. Then I put it on the ends of my hair and work it up to about my ears, because the top of my hair is never getting tangled like the rest.",5
"As you age, your skin starts hanging, just like the girls do, and you will want to use products to prevent that sagging skin. This is a set that offers you anti-wrinkling and whitening in the ampoule serum, repair skin softener and repair lifting cream. This is a great starter size.",5
"I use so many products that give me moisture. I think I am addicted to them. What I know, is that from using this Celimax product and another one that I use, my face keeps moisture in it and that helps keep wrinkles from showing (which is where the hyaluronic acid comes in)",5
"these cloths are pre-moistened with coconut oil so that you can use them on the most sensitive skin. You get 12 packs with 40 cloths in each pack. That equals out to 480 cloths.  Nice for traveling, Make sure you read all disposal instructions.",5
I have grandchildren who are all teens. Some have an occasional break out and others will have breakouts quite often. The set comes with a cleansing wash and a night repairing cream. These heal and clear your skin without drying your skin out.,5
"Remy human hair is one of the most popular type and wanted type in the market. These extensions have a lace weft with seamless clip ins. You will most likely want help getting them in, especially if you are new at this. Instant hair length.",5
"In case I like the job they do, I bought a few others too. Tonight, is the first time I will use these. I am going to leave them on for the longer period because I get those yucky heels from walking barefoot all the time. I just put my first pair on and now have to wait to remove them and wash my feet.",4
"It has a facial cleanser, a Salicylic acid treatment and a vitamin C serum for hydration, moisture and collagen. These items are meant for a beauty salon and is typically used in a hydra facial dermabrasion. Each bottle is 13.5 ounces, so this would last an individual a life time.",5
"Right now they are perky, the point right at the floor. I would like them to look up. This down business is no bueno. So, I will use this as instructed and if things work out, you will see an update.",5
"and this is a seven day ampoule set that will give you those results at the end of seven days. In addition to four different advanced Hyaluronic Acids (low, medium and high) + Booster Tripeptides that work together, you will see results. I follow mine with the Doctor Babor Glow Cream, which I really like.",5
"but I found the directions. When I was opening this, I noticed that the cellophane was covering a box that is in a sleeve. The outer sleeve is different in very small ways and looks more costly than the inner box. Anyway, the directions say to apply to clean skin before the night cream. I should see results in 8 days. It went on nicely and it is a nice sized bottle for drops.",5
"I am impressed. If you have sensitive skin, this is a great product for you. I have dry skin that also has eczema and sometimes rosacea. This does not aggravate either of the conditions and I really like that it is a barrier cream. That helps my skin retain moisture.",5
"This moisturizer, Tula Probiotic Skin Care, is the right consistency for day and/or night. It was nice applying the product and your face feels dewy moist.  This is much more preferable than feeling dry, oily or sticky. The scent is strongest when you open and apply. Then it softens and you can barely smell the scent. The ingredients list the scent as parfum/perfume, so you don't know exactly what it is.",5
"This is a 3 piece mini set that includes Universal C Skin Refiner, Universal Pro Bio Moisture Boost Cream, Universal Moisture Essence. When you use these products, you will have moisturized skin all day long and you will reap the benefits of rejuvenated, nourished skin.",5
"This is a bubbling mask. If you have ever used one, you know already that when you put it on, it starts bubbling. This one starts bubbling after you have wet your face and then applied. The bubbling mask is great for cleaning your pores and it is also fun.",4
"before I can make a decision about how effective they are. As with most facial products, you don't see results immediately (unless it is one of those eye products that smooth and reduce puffiness under your eyes). I will use these daily until they are gone and change my review if necessary.",4
"The girl needs more dip colors, so she will get this set. It comes with eight dip colors, tools for cuticles and for filing, and it also comes with a base coat, an activator, top coat, liquid brush cleaner for the base coat, activator and top coat and a nice nail brush to brush off excess dip powder. .",5
"These are so pretty. The glittery look is great - especially for younger women. Personally, I like the marbled colors. So, the girl and I will split this set up and she can have the colors that are more age appropriate for her and I will have the colors more age appropriate for me.",5
"So, to try this out, I followed the directions, opened the LED part and removed the blue battery saver paper. Then I reassembled, making sure that the batteries were in the correct position. Then, I could not get the thing to turn on. I tried in different parts of my face, holding it there and nothing happened.",2
"This product is a thicker than normal cream - but when you get some out, it is similar to a balm - without the instant melt of a balm. This spreads easily over your face. Got to say I like it. I put it over some other products I had tried. This is the winner.",5
"Because of anti depressants I take, my eyes are typically dry and I have to use moisturizing drops. If a speck of dust or a piece of hair gets near my eyes, it feels like it is scratching my eyeball. So this is a blessing for my eyes. I spend a bit of time each evening wearing this. You do have to connect it to power, but that isn't an issue for me.",5
I will probably give them to the girl. She is big in the winged liner and she does a great job. To add the eyelashes will be a snap for her. I would most likely need someone to assist me. Old age does not make it easier doing special things like lashes and liners.,4
This is a human hair wig made for women of color. They have used wigs for years and no how to color them and curl and straighten the hair properly. I will not be using it as a wig for me. I will be using it to make wigs for some of my valuable dolls so they can have a new look.,4
"To me, it smells like it isn't fresh. It might be the shea butter or one of the oils or some other mystery ingredient. When you use it and wipe it off, it makes your lips feel dry and you will definitely need a lip moisturizer or lip mask.",3
I like that this has floating ceramic tourmaline plates. I also like that it has a fast heat up. And I like that it has the recommended heat level for different types of hair. I especially like the automatic shut off after 60 minutes and the easy restart.,5
"Doesn't matter if they are a gel, spray, cream or whatever way delivered. They work great and your skin will appreciate being moisturized all day long. This helps repair your skin to and reduce wrinkles.",5
"In my guest bathroom, I have a nice mirror with lights, but it isn't movable and it doesn't have magnification or a change in the light to reflect white, warm and evening. This requires 4 AAA batteries. But it also comes with a charging cord, so you can put that in a USB outlet or charger and not use the batteries at all.",4
"This facial cream can be used in the morning and in the evening. Thankfully, the instructions for English are on the web site. DAY Care- Apply adequate amount on clean skin. Pat gently to absorb.<br />NIGHT Care (Recommended for 2-3 times per week)<br />- Apply on clean face and neck. Pat gently to absorb, then apply another layer. Leave overnight.<br />I love how this feels on my skin.",5
"For those that are wanting to dip their fingers and toes into something different, this is a good starter kit. It comes with enough poly gel nail builder, that you can try different ways and colors to determine if this is something for you.",5
"In the nicely packaged box, you get a brightening cleanser, a brightening toner, a brightening lotion, a brightening cream, a brightening eye cream and a brightening essence. The products are meant to be used together and you use them as instructed. The instructions are all in Chinese, so what they did for use who can only speak English, they have attached instructions in English on the back of the packaging. The box has shrink wrap so you are able to pull the directions away from the clear wrap and put it on your box. Hopefully, you do a better job and putting it on than I did. But it works.",5
"and am leaving it on overnight. With the other product I am wearing overnight, my face feels so dewy and so soft. I like it.",5
They are so relaxing and you can leave them on longer than you can a mask. I like to put mine in the refrigerator so that they are even more soothing. Try it.,4
"This time, I am trying three different items. I am trying the Virtue cream for you neck and décolletage, the Silk moisturizing cream and the Bright lifting eye cream. Because I put other products on my face and eye area earlier, I am putting this on my hands and arm. I love the feel of the Silk moisturizing cream, the Virtue cream is thicker than your other moisturizers, and the eye lifting cream. The eye lifting cream is applied in dots so you only go around your eye area. The Silk moisturizing cream is really nice and can be used on your face daily.",5
"I get the girl gel nails, poly nails, acrylic, you name it and all the bells and whistles. She got some last year, but they were only the gel nails and she has requested the other types and a more powerful LED/UL curing light to make things go faster. I have gotten her the sets like this, the decorative pieces and much more.",5
"I have used other Easydew products and most I like. I like this one. It goes on easy and is absorbed quickly. If it makes my skin look better, I am all in.",5
"When I first put it on my face, it felt so thick and I started thinking this was going to be way to thick and heavy feeling But it is absorbing into my skin quite well. The product is unscented but the natural scent of the oil kind of smells like old olive oil. But that smell goes away too.",5
"When you use the cushioning color control, you get skin protection, color coverage, color correction and hydration. It feels nice going on your face and keeps your face hydrated. Good stuff.",5
"But once it did prime, it let enough out to work on my eyes this morning. It felt cool thanks to metal eye roller. My eyes looked better and felt moisturized for hours.",5
"the girl, her mom and I all do our own nails. We started out with curing lamps that took a while to cure. Now we want bigger, better and faster. We got it. I would recommend  a stronger lamp for any home user.",5
"my face is soft and doesn't feel greasy, but feels moisturized. This was my mid day application of a face serum or cream. I like the facial oils. They are always nice and require only drops.",5
"I have been trying several different products from this company. Now, this is an emulsion that is used to moisturize day and night. I have already moisturized my face. I have to say this is not as good smelling as the other products I have used from this company, but it does have good, natural ingredients.",5
"It smells so darn good. You will enjoy applying it to your face. It is specifically beneficial to lips, forehead, eyes, and nose to help fight aging. At my age, I applied it on my entire face and specifically on the areas specified.",5
"I have dry skin, unless I use moisturizers daily. I have been using this product a few times daily, just to keep my face moisturized. It feels good going on.",4
"She will be happy to have several didn't colors to join the set I already have for her. The colors are pretty. Make sure you follow all directions. I have not used poly gels before, so I will have her read the directions carefully. She will love the additional colors.",5
"Just tried this out on my hands so that I could see how it works and smells. It smells good. The smell does dissipate after time. I am not so sure how I feel about a foam for my body, but I will adjust. When I wash, I prefer to use a pouf and this will work with gel or foam, so I won't even notice. I think I am going to be liking this and looking for more",5
"My little dog loves to get my stuff when I sleep. He pretends to be sleeping most of the night, but somewhere in the middle, when I am asleep, he snatches my lip balms and serums. I have had to throw quite a few away after his wonderful chewing power. At least with these, if I keep them hidden, he will not get them.",5
"These headbands remind me of the Baroque era. When you look at some of the paintings during that period, women had pieces like this in their hair. I find them a little much for me. Not sure if I like them or not. Because I wear glasses, the placement isn't correct.",4
"This oil is loaded with good stuff and it doesn't take but just a few drops to spread over your face and neck area. Best part, is that it doesn't feel like oil on your face. It gets absorbed immediately. I like it.",5
"This oil is loaded with good stuff and it doesn't take but just a few drops to spread over your face and neck area. Best part, is that it doesn't feel like oil on your face. It gets absorbed immediately. I like it.",5
This is a completely different product than the other oils by the same company. It isn't even the same color or consistency. This one requires two drops to cover your face and décolleté. A little goes a long way.,5
"I have used tools like these for years. They make my nails look so shiny and also helps make the ridges less noticeable. I especially like the nano laser cut. For a regular nail file, they don't work as well on the tips. I use a glass nail file for that too, but it isn't a nano laser cut one.",5
"I have dry skin, so this is perfect for me. It makes my face feel like I have moisture in it, which is exactly what I need. I have tried many creams and this one is in my favorites category.",5
"I applied this to my face and I have to say, it made my face feel good. I couldn't wait until night time to put this on. I have been on vacation and needed extra moisturizing now. This did it.",5
"but it sure makes your skin feel better. I put it on my troubled toe and the skin absorbed every bit of it. Half and hour later, it was like I didn't put anything on it. The product reminds me of the products you used to get years ago that were a hard cream.",4
"When you read the directions on this, you will see you need a base coat - that is not included in this set. So you will need to use your own base coat for gel nails. Not an issue. Then you apply your black polish, then the glitter. Make sure you use your UV/LED lamp between steps to cure.",5
"It does wonders for your old skin. Mine is pretty old and you would never even know I put it on. It only took drops that I put in my palm, rubbed with the other palm and applied to the targeted areas.",5
My current gel/uv dryer takes a bit of time to cure my nails. I am trying this one which is 150 watt. Lots of difference than my old one.,5
"Many blow dryers I don't use very often, simply because I have long hair and I want to keep damage to a minimum. With this one, it dries faster (use the hair towels that help remove excess water first). The ionic dryer does a decent job and I like that this one is lighter than my current blow dryer. I like that it also has a diffuser and two different concentrators",4
"When I opened up the box, the tube of MBA was right there. It is not a jar, but a tube that you pump the product out. The circular on the inside advises newbies to use one pump all over the face and avoiding the eyes, mouth and neck areas. You start out twice a week or every three days. After two or three weeks, the skin adjusts to the usage and you can start using more often. They also included a trial size of Double Major, which is great, since you will probably have dead skin cells start to flake off.",5
This is such a lightweight product and is very moisturizing on my dry skin. I even like the smell. It just smells like a sliced cucumber but not quite as obvious as cucumber. This goes on so softly. It is truly light and it easily glides across your skin. I am loving this.,5
"I have used the day gel, the night gel and now this facial oil. I like how all of them make my face and neck feel. I also like the smell. I like all the natural oils that have been blended to create this facial oil. If you have dry skin, this is wonderful for your face.",5
"Once you squirt this out, it is quite thin. I put it on the back of my hand and rubbed it in easily. It left a sheen on my skin, even after I washed my hands. Not sure how well this will work in the sun. I burn easily and I will be applying this fairly often, especially after being in the water. I try not to stay too long in the sun because I am fair skinned and have already had about 4 skin cancers, so it is a must for me to use products like this, that is also good for my skin and makes me look better.",4
It doesn't take much of this product to cover your entire face (except eye area). I have older skin and need a product like this to help make my skin supple.,5
It felt good on my skin. I put it on after I applied Ageless. Then I added a few drops of Angel Skin. I want to make sure I take advantage of all the skin care I can get. This seems to be a good start.,5
"My face was feeling a little itchy, so I put this on my face. My face feels better already. I use the Ageless also and find both facial oils to be excellent.",5
"I am going to take the capsules to continue my nail and hair growth and overall good health with the vitamins and minerals. In the meantime, my husband is using the shampoo and conditioner to wash and condition his hair. He likes it.",5
"I have this sitting next to me so I can apply it in the morning or night, whichever I choose. I find it very moisturizing and it spreads easily. I like it and I can feel that my face feels nice",5
This dissolves the most difficult makeup - including water resistant mascara and foundation. You just apply some to your palms and then massage all over your face and then rinse with cool water and pat dry. Your face won't feel tight.,5
"If you want a nice full head of hair, you will want at the minimum, 3 bundles. Four or five would be better if you want lots of fullness. The hair is nice and can be washed, conditioned, dyed and styled, like you would your own natural hair.",5
"You could use one bundle of this fantastic hair, but it would be a little on the thin side. Two bundles will give you fuller hair. You can do more with multiple bundles.",5
I am guessing that the ingredients are as listed on the selling page. It is an entire list. Some of the ingredients are listed in different places and they may not be the same as the others. Everything I have tried from the line has worked well for me.,4
"I can put one in my purse, some in my luggage and be able to wear the scents I want to wear each day and night.",4
These are super easy to use. And you can use them around your mouth too. They will give you a lot of Vitamin A to the area where you put them and they will help to refine the texture and correct the tone.,4
"The girl and her friends love to use make up and all parts that extend from it, like lash extensions. I have given her lashes and the glue to practice with. She will end up practicing until she gets the look and then she will give a you tube presentation on how to apply them.",3
This mascara does give me volume and length. I love the wand. It is one I might just keep using after this is all gone. I  like how this mascara gives me nice looking lashes and enhance my eyes. Good stuff. This mascara even made the top 20 Best Mascaras of all Time.,5
"When you order this, you have to decide if you want to keep this for yourself or give it to someone else. It is not going to be an easy choice, because if you like a nice day cream and eye serum, you will want to keep this.",4
"I haven't used this one long enough to determine if my lashes are growing. But they are getting darker. Of course, the growth is over a period of time, so it isn't always easy to see how much they may have grown when you look at them every day. When other people notice a difference, you know you are there.",4
"I will be using this human hair to fashion wigs for collectible bjd resin dolls. If you are familiar with these types of dolls, they wear wigs and most are either mohair or synthetic hair. So, it is a bonus to have real hair that you can wash and style as you want.",4
"This face wash is soap free, smells nice and it also deep cleans. It looks like cleansers are going to non suds and that is fine with me. I am heading the same way with my shampoo.",5
"Because this is Hyaluronic acid only, you will want to use a good moisturizer, if your skin is showing signs of dryness. This works better on younger skin and skin with acne. I use a good moisturizer afterwards.",4
"I had my daughter help me put these on. It is difficult for me to do this by myself. The end result looked pretty good. We followed the entire set of directions to get the best possible result, since neither of us is a professional. I even put some on her.",4
"Follow all directions carefully. You apply thin layers of the liner and let dry in between each layer. Then you apply your lashes, which are held in place by the magnets in the liner. Once you get the hang of it, you will find it very easy. And your eyes will look great.",4
"As we get older, we lose hair and sometimes get thin spots. This is great. It is easy to use and works great. It is very easy to use. You just shake it out of the container. And then you don't see a bunch of skin with nothing on it. Works great and it is easy. And when you shower, it is going to wash out of your hair. And then you are ready for the next time you want to cover thinning areas. Follow all directions.",4
"when you want to go somewhere and look like you have a tan, you can use this. Follow directions for application. It dries within one minute. Fast and gives you that nice tan.",4
"I used it daily until I put it away and forgot where so that the puppy would not steal it. Too expensive to lose to Tucker. I don't have acne, but I do have dry skin. It works great on old, aged skin.",5
"I find this easy to learn the basic skills. I want to be able to do my lips and eyeliner. I don't want anything crazy, just a light touch and I am hoping I will learn enough to be able to do that with this machine,",4
"I have that thin strands of hair that can be enhanced with this product. My hair tends to get limp looking. In fact, most of the time it is in a hair clip or a scrunchy. This helps make my hair stronger, have more volume and styling is much nicer looking.",4
"The shinier, the better. She likes this eyeshadow. Because it is a powder, she has to build up the color if used by itself or over another color. Her eyes just shimmer.",4
"I have long, thin hair that tangles easily and the big comb felt like it was ripping my hair out. I decided to gift these to my husband and the boy. They both have short hair and it is better suited for them",3
"This one worked okay. I like this one. But to be honest, my nail drill does a better and quicker job. This is okay for people who need a little smoothing here and there. I need a grinder. It works okay, just not powerful enough for my feet.",4
"This is a perfect bundle for me. The barrier cream I have to apply several times a day, because I wash my hands all the time. I like the hand cleaner. Dirt and grime get cleaned off wonderfully and my hands get exfoliated. Then, I finish up with the salve. That helps relieve the cracks from dry skin.",4
"I was able to put my hair up using two clips to hold it in place. They stayed put until I took them down later in the day. These are good at holding hair. You may need several of these if you have thick hair. My strands are long and thin, so I could easily wrap them into a bun and clip on either side.",4
"This serum helps fight dark spots, smooths skin and fights aging. After using on a regular basis, you will see results. This will help your skin be moisturized and with use, will help exfoliate the dead cells. Using the cleanser, the toner, the Vitamin C serum and this will do wonders for your skin.",5
"and before moisturizing This serum helps fight dark spots, smooths skin and fights aging. After using on a regular basis, you will see results. Follow this up with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C Daily Face Moisturizer by the same company and you will definitely have a good skin care regimen.",5
My daughter takes every Argan oil I get from me. She needs it for her and the girl's hair. They love how Argan oil works on their hair and my daughter also likes how it makes her skin feel better and not as dry.,5
"It seems that the brush cleaner is missing. The pouch is average, the brushes are okay, but if you are expecting to get that bottle of cleaner, hope it arrives in yours.",3
"This skin gel is wonderful. It helps to heal and it creates a barricade. It goes on easily with a pump and stays on your skin all day. It is tacky initially, but your skin will love the gel.",4
"I did not think they were still making them. But guess what? There is a web site where you can purchase Fuller Brush products and even Stanley brushes. I definitely remember the old style Stanley brush. That was what my mom used for her hair and for our bottoms. The Fuller Hair brush is nicely made out of wood and has boar's hairs, which leaves your hair shiny and your scalp well brushed.",5
"This cleansing foam does a great job exfoliating and cleaning. Very easy to use. You put some in your hand and lather it up until it turns into a foam and then massage on your face and then rinse with lukewarm water. It doesn't scrub, but it definitely cleanses well.",4
"Because I get cracks in my heels and very dry feet, my dermatologist recommended using a product with urea in it. This also have anti fungal ingredients. This will help your feet soften. I have eczema on some spots on my feet. The heels and two toes. This causes really dry, thick areas. This is helping.",4
"This is not the best quality of hair, so it makes it perfect for trying out on your head at home. I had my daughter help me put these in. We both watched videos and are still discussing the pros and cons. Now, I am not sure how you are supposed to brush near your scalp with these in, so I will need to watch a video for that too. If I decide not to use them on my head, then I will use them to make a wig for my bjd collectibles. If I do use them on my hair, after the tape has had its full life then I will find something to do with these. They are going to be used, one way or the other.",5
"So, naturally, they all wanted these. None have told me how they work but I am presuming okay. If I get something like this, they want it immediately. I am sure that all three have used everyone of these patches and probably want more.",4
"The goat milk facial cleanser not only cleanses your face but it also moisturizes, hydrates and exfoliates. A nice way to take care of your face before you apply your day or night serum, lotion or creams. Good stuff.",4
These are great ones to learn with. They are already just to set in place. They have adhesive already. You just pick one with the tweezers and set it where you want it on your eyelashes. This is going to be my practice set to get used to using other kinds.,5
"However, from the pictures, I have gleaned that you put some in your hands and rub it on your face and wait a few minutes for it to dry. Then you will roll and it will make little balls that are peeling the dead skin like a magnet. You don't need to rinse afterwards. you just roll off the product and it is all done and your face is smooth and silky soft.",4
"However, I have attached a screen shot that shows the directions on the web page. With this product, you apply, massage and then rinse with warm water. It is easy to use and your face will thank you for the cleansing.",4
"I am looking over the ingredients on the selling page and I see that snail jelly is one of the masks. I didn't see any of the snail mucin listed in the ingredients. Does it contain snail mucin or not? I don't know. But, the masks are nice and who doesn't like to use a facial mask to get that nice spa feeling? As long as my face is moistened, then I think I did well.",4
"This mask is a little bit different from others, Many are like paper. This one is a bit heavier and you will want to probably lay down while you have this on so that it doesn't slip. Follow the Directions: STEP 1. Remove the film<br />Clear up the skin with toner after cleansing, take the mask pack and remove the white film on one side. STEP 2. Attach the mask pack.  Attach the upper half with your eyes at the center and the lower half with your mouth at the center. Tip! It is better to attach the lower part first. STEP 3. Absorption. Remove the mask after 30 minutes and absorb the essence remaining on the skin by lightly tapping it with your fingers. The final on this mask is that it feels good, it does a good job and I am glad there are 3 more I can use before I have to buy more",4
"Because there are ten items and 2 you leave on overnight, you need instructions on what to do with each one. What I did, was make a screen print of the instructions so I will know how to use each. When these came in, it was like trying to hold an open bag of potatoes. The packaging was not good and I had these pods falling all over the place. What is in each pod? Got me. Makes my face feel good though. The only ingredients on the selling page is honey, yogurt and sugar. I know there has to be different ingredients for each pod, so that is definitely not right for the ingredients,",4
"This is great foundation, sunscreen and moisturizer all in one. It is a totally different product than what we are accustomed to. It is a foundation and mask all in one that keeps your skin looking good all day long. This is good for anti aging, wrinkles, troubled skin and lightening of dark areas.",5
"This is more than just castor oil. Castor oil has been used forever to lengthen lashes. This product does more than castor oil. You should use it twice daily for best results. One thing I like about this, is that if it gets in your eye, it isn't harmful. That is different from most.",4
"I need this product. I do not want to take hormones and this helps naturally. When you no longer produce hormones, you get a lot of dryness and the dryness can get irritated and then you get itching. This helps. I recommend it",4
"You usually need a lip scrub, especially during the winter. I use chap sticks, oils and botanicals to keep my lips kissably soft. I still have to exfoliate with a scrub. This one smells nice and you only need a pea sized amount and rub it over your lips in a circular motion and then rinse with water. Then you can put on a lip moisturizer for night.",4
"It is much better suited for getting my hair to dry than using a huge bath sheet or large bath towel. It is much lighter and when I remove it, a lot of the water is already gone.",4
I was able to get my eyebrows filled in and looking great in just seconds. One eyebrow had a little oops but I used a paper towel and my nail to smooth out the area and it looks great. I could use a lighter shade but this looks fine.,5
"In fact, I would buy it. More than once. I like the scent and I like how it cleans my hair. I should have gotten the other products available. It is lovely",4
"I gave this to my daughter, who is going to be extra careful due to the broken top. If it goes on the side, it is going to leak and that was before I unwrapped the package. My daughter loves argan oil so she is going to use it rather than me throw it away.",3
"These eyelashes are reusable. They are very long and give you a thick and long eyelash look. The lashes are made to last up to 25 times. I am going to be using them on ball jointed resin dolls that need new lashes. If they are too long, you can also trim them for the length of lashes or for the eyelid size.",5
This reminds me so much of the first 3D mascara from Younique. This will do the same. Put on one coat of the top part and then a coat of the bottom part of the mascara. You can build up the lashes to the point that they look like fake lashes.,5
"I live in Florida, where humidity runs rampant. It is hot and humid for most of the year. My hair is also fine, which means it will frizz easily. This is a wonderful product for my hair. When I go some place nice and have fixed my hair, it is wonderful to use the shaping spray and it not frizzing up after spray and not feeling hard.",5
"Salt scrubs are great. The salt in this scrub is small enough texture that it isn't too rough and makes your skin feel good afterwards. Especially with the other ingredients. After finishing, my skin felt smoother and I smelled better. The scent is not overwhelming. It is on the delicate side.",5
"When you go on a 7 day cruise, you generally pack up your beauty creams and lotions and your hair care items, like shampoo, conditioner, hot iron protector, etc. That is if you drive. All of these items take up a lot of space and they way down your luggage. These just came in and I am going to take these instead. The bottles have big holes for pouring in your liquids and the small containers can easily hold enough facial creams to last a week. The bottles have a flip top to get the liquid out. The others are screw on lids that you can unscrew to get to the creams.",5
This electric drill comes with about 11 different drill bits and sanding pieces for the grinders. This also comes with a brush to remove the powder you get from the drill. You also get spreaders for your hands. It also has dust covers for the drill and an emery board. This is strong enough to also use on your pets to grind down their nails.,4
"I don't know if these will get much use. I don't know how to use them properly for my eyebrows and will have to do some u tubing to find out. There are not any instructions included. I do know I will not use them on any area other than my eyebrows. Some women will probably use them on their upper lip and chin area but not me. I have always felt like if you shave some areas, more hair grows back in. This may be a myth. But my daughter shaved her belly and her arms and she has hair growth that is darker than what she had previously. She did this for a few years and has since stopped, but the hairs on her torso are now an embarrassment for her.",3
"You will need a nail gel lamp to cure the gel. From my experience with different lamps, leave your nails in the curing lamp for the maximum time. This is quite handy and easy to use. Follow all instructions and you should get great results. Hint: when you go to start your  nails, put a coat of Elmer's glue around your skin around the nail and it will keep the gel, base and top coat from sticking to your skin.",4
"This is used on your body to break the cells in the epidermis and allow moisturizers to be absorbed more efficiently. I have this one, plus a lip and facial attachment head and I am very pleased with them all.",4
"Everywhere you turn, quartz jade rollers are being sold. They are used to massage your face. The roller helps to reduce puffiness on your face and eye area and the flat piece is a massager. If you don't have one of these, you might want to try one out. The nice coolness on your face feels great.",4
"You can stay on top of invoices, manage expenses, get reliable reports for tax time and import your data from a spreadsheet. You can also download your banking data and manage your business more efficiently. You don't need to have an accounting background - tutorials will help you all the way.",4
"I am very careful with heat that I apply to my hair and I don't use it often, just to keep the hair free from split ends. This worked much better than I anticipated. The infrared didn't seem to hurt my hair and it doesn't have a bunch of frizzees from where it will fall off if the heat is too high. I have had beauticians use to much heat and have that happen. I am pleased with this iron.",5
but it feels good when I rub it on my face. And the flat stone feels good too. The stones are nice and cool and very smooth.,4
"If you use this properly, you should get very good results. It comes with a net that you can put on your head first and then add the grip scarf. It is adjustable and it is also washable.",4
"This 16 inch pack of human hair extensions are nice. This color is off black and has 20 pieces. I will be using these to make a wig for my collector doll, as human hair is a lot easier to work with than man made synthetic.",5
"I am wearing a facial mask right now and I used this tool to help get it all spread out and when I remove the mask, I will be using the tool again to get the product left on my face worked in. This roller isn't as well made as my other one. It seems flimsy but it still does the job.",4
I am using these braids to make doll wigs for collectible fashion dolls. These will work out great to give an updated look to some of my girls.,4
"Right now, I am loving this combo straightener and curling tool. It heats up to 430 degrees, but it is in Celsius, so look at the conversion for your hair. It heats up very fast. I straightened a piece of hair and then curled it. It did a good job. I am tempted to do my entire head. What I really like is the extra long grip that keeps you from burning your fingers",5
I have really come to like the floating plates. I like how it doesn't pull my hair like the standard hair straighteners. I also like that it has ceramic plates with tourmaline. It leaves my hair shiny and feeling good. I only have to play with the temperature gauge so that my thin hair doesn't burn off.,4
"Here is a product that you charge via USB, and have enough power to shave your legs if you want. I don't have the best eyesight and when I use a razor, I often miss areas. I used this today and I had a good amount of cleaning to do on the head and brushing out the hairs. This is the most hairs I have ever been able to remove with an electric or chargeable razor. You can also wash your face with the scrubber and trim your sideburns and more. This is also waterproof. The instructions are all in Chinese, but you can see from the pictures what to do and how to lift the rotaries to brush the hairs out.",4
"This gel nail set comes with 6 different colors that they have themed as ""Love Spectrum"". The colors are quite nice. You will need to get a UV LED Lamp. You will also need to get the Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish Soak Off UV LED Gel Base Coat and No Wipe Top Coat Gel Polish Set. All of these items can be purchased on Amazon. They recommend that you put on layers and each layer should be thin. Follow all instructions and you will have beautiful shiny nails.",4
"I am on my second day of using this product. I have used other products - some work, some do nothing. I am hoping for the former on this. It has a very thin applicator brush so you can just line the upper part of your eyelashes and when dry, you can apply mascara. I haven't had any adverse reactions. I will know more as time goes on. It looks like my lashes are darker already, but that could be my wishful thinking.",4
"The needles in the eye microtip are not very long and they are very thin, so it is a breeze to go over your eye area and eyebrow area without pain and with ease. I want all of the needling attachment heads. These are the best I have used to date.",5
"This is a wonderful tool. If you get that rough, callused skin on your heels, this is the most fantastic thing you will ever use. It works quickly and you can use it daily to keep that dry skin at bay. I love mine so much, I got one for my daughter. She used mine and loved it, so this is making a perfect gift for her! &#60;3",5
Swiss Botany makes wonderful products and I have never been disappointed. The serum soaks in and your skin gets smooth. Anything that works on almost 60 year old skin is fantastic in my book,5
"This facial moisturizer is great. when you use hyaluronic acid products, you should follow with a good moisturizer. This fits the bill. Now, I have a complete set of this line that I am very pleased with. They also make a body moisturizer that is great on your heels.",5
I love this foot buffer!. I would recommend anyone who gets one of these little babies to go with the rechargeable over the battery-operated. The rechargeable stays powerful and I can keep the power strong by using the cord on it at the same time. My heels are very dry and crack easily. This helps buff those rough areas easily and makes my feet smoother all over. Love it!,5
"These bath bombs work well, and they smell good🙂",5
I really like this DatingDay A Set of 7 Pcs manicure set☺<br />Happy ^Buy☺,5
Wonderful wish I could find the bigger rougher ones again.,5
Worst pain ever...,1
"I tried using this with almost every nail polish I have.... and no matter what, it would not work!!! My nail polish last MUCH longer with no base coat!!!! This stuff seems to make the nail polish come off faster! :'( very disappointed I wasted my money on this",2
So pretty,4
Love them fast shipping!,5
It was way to small,1
"Light as a feather  , very cute for daily wear, very functional and looks much more expensive than some wigs I've paid a lot more for wigs and I still choose to wear this one!<br />It's light as a feather very comfortable. All I did was conceal the part doesn't need slot of work. This unit is awesome I bought 2 more if that tells you anything!<br />I haven't noticed any Shedding and I wear this unit a lot!! I love it one of my favorites out of 26 that I own. It's not a lace front and it doesn't clam to be either but for 15 dollars you can't beat it.<br />The only con is it doesn't have any clips. It does have the adjustable straps though.",5
"Most mascaras irritate my eyes.  This mascara goes on easy, last all day, and not irritation.  Great price - highly recommend.",5
I had never considered using this product before.  In the past I had always used the tube type and then mouthwash.  No more!!  I love this product.  It taste great and leaves your mouth feeling cleaned and refreshed.  Eliminates clutter on you counter since it is a 2 in 1 product.  Highly recommend.,5
Dries quickly.,5
"Normally, you can't get close to the nail on any tough cuticle snags. It was no problem with this set.  Things I have been trying to resolve are now no longer bothering me.  With all of the handwashing we do now dry skin allows for cuticles to snag on hair, clothing and other things.  Keeping the cuticle trimmed and neat is key to nail health. I can now manage my cuticle maintenance without a salon visit. Happy Clipping!!",5

Great  value!,4
"These were a huge disappointment. Didn’t expect much for the price, but they are cheeeaaapp cheap. Embarrassingly so.",1
My daughter Loves them. I feel they were slightly over priced but went for it since they were her school colors.,4
The lightest shade was crushed upon arrival,4
I picked this up w/ my last haircut. I love that it doesn’t leave my hair crunchy. It has a light hold and you can barely feel the product when you run your hands through your hair. It helps my curls keep their shape a bit longer while still keeping flexibility. I plan to purchase again.,4
I received this concealer in a sample bag. I really like it but it would sometimes end up cakey looking on my nose especially after a few hours of use. The color was perfect for my olive skin tone and I did consistently use it to cover my discolorations.,3
"Love form fist sight.<br />I am the person who likes minimalistic design, interior and keep them throughput it everything.<br />Everything need to be matchjng.<br />So find this shower gel and it’s perfect decoration and product at the same time!<br />Love the scent . And it looks amazing in shower.<br />Love.",5
Super powerful suction! Stuff came out my nose but at the end it left marks. Like lots of marks. I looked like  Rudolph .. but still pretty good.,4
Love it!!! It’s not too of the line of course! But worth it for the price!,5
These sheets are long enough to do your own back. All over exfoliater and not harsh. Im very happy with this product!,5
"It worked the first two days for me, then hasn't worked well enough to use. Have had to use 2-3 times a day to have any effect but it never completely eliminated a scent of perspIration.  I've used it since January ...It's now March 8 and I give up. Trying a different deodorant.",3
Clearly this does Not say Alcohol! SMH! I bought this because it was supposed to say Alcohol which is what I want to put in it!  Will it still work? Sure. But when it’s sold as saying Alcohol I expect it to look like what the pictures and description shows!,3
"Soft, large size, came undone after a week",2
"These took forever to receive, almost 3 weeks, but they were exactly what I was looking for and the price was right. I'm an adult and they don't look like little kid barrettes!",5
Too small and flimsy,2
"Not sure this does much of anything but it's a very nice lotion. Very thick, takes a while to rub in",3
"The colors are pretty and it seems to be pretty durable, but they aren’t extra large. My kids love them",5
so cute good quality.,5
"I tried to use this expensive scar cream to rid of my facial acne scars and cat scratches on my arms and legs. None of the scratches or scars minimized after daily use for 6 weeks. It didn't burn or anything with application, it just was completely ineffective, so I stopped using it.",1
"This is the best shampoo I have ever purchased in my life. My hair went from being sometimes frizzy, sometimes straight, sometimes in between to easy to manage, straight, super shiny, healthy hair that I have always desired. I get tons of compliments from others and people often ask me what I use because my hair looks so good. I wash my hair three times a week with this shampoo and I don't even need the accompanying conditioner because the shampoo is so moisturizing in and of itself. However, the conditioner does add a little protection and shine when using hair dryers and straighteners. I highly recommend this product!",5
Exactly what I was looking for,5
Youngest daughter complains how awful they feel but my oldest daughter likes how they stay put. Bad part is the metal prongs get bent extremely easy!,4
"Not sure if this product help me, Manila still breaks at the side",2
it did the job. you get what you pay for,5
"This was a stocking stuffer for my bearded husband for Christmas. He's not much into personal grooming, but he actually uses the comb to shape his beard every morning. When I can get him to start using the brush, I'll try to update my review.",5
"Small & hard.  Used two, then threw out & replaced with Q-tip brand.",1
"Perfect and less expensive alternative to the beautyblender!  Why spend close to $20 for one sponge, when you can get these for about $1/sponge.  As with any sponge, you have to be concerned with bacteria and possible infections, and I find it much easier to part with less expensive ones like this.",5
I'm on week 5 of using once a week to shave my head. I have to clean it every other use and have not had to charge yet.,5
Felt good.  Did it actually do anything??,5
Works well to keep electric shaver clean. 4 Stars.,4
"Just sad that I did not know of this product much earlier. Much better than a wash rag, or wash towel, much more durable, and because of its texture it does help to get rid of dead skin, that appears are always present, in less or greater quantities. Dries fairly soon, and because of its tiny pores and antibacterial capabilities, it barely hold on to odors as long as it is properly washed and rinsed before hanging. Nice invention, pretty darn smart, if you ask me. Long enough for a person to do their own back, and works like one with liquid soap creating plenty of clean foam. 4 Stars for this japanese product.",4
"Over the years I have purchased my share of this company product, including their shaving gel. When it comes down to it, I do get a nice shave from this Fusion (late model?), and I agree with so many smart shoppers when they mention the price on these things (the blades) is ridiculously high. This package was a very nice deal and I wanted an extra razor, which looks very nice on the Limited Edition, and the extra 2 Cartridges that came along with it. I bought not too long ago the Limited Edition Coast Guard of this same brand, and that one I really dig.<br />In my case I have always found that I replace the blades every 8 uses, and I like the safe way they are designed, but still it is advisable to shave carefully when using sharp blades. 4 Stars!",4
I gave this 3 star because this is not a frontal wig. The title should be different there is a very small section of lace. I gave the wig away not what I wanted at all!,3
Great product at a great price!,5
Received in good condition!,5
"When you pay as much as I do for my hair, I want to protect the color. This conditioner protects color treated hair by using Moroccan oil. The conditioner smells good but hair was still a bit tangled. I will keep using.",4
These work great on my dip nails,5
Made for a fun gift for my stinky husband.  He keeps in his soccer bag to &#34;towel off&#34; before getting back into his car.  He's pretty gross.,5
Unusual brush. A little difficult to use.,3
"I love this foundation, it matches my skin tone and it stay on a long time. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others.",5
This hair for passion twist is great.  It came with 6 packs and the were pre-looped. The hair had no smell and once installed it looked great.  I have order it more than once and would recommend it to anyone.,5
"This lotion may not be as thick on the skin as others, but that's why I like it.  The scent is clean and lasting, I hope Amazon keeps it in stock.",5
Less then half full,1
"Not as moisturizing as I had hoped.  My hair isn't dry, but can easily become dry.  Although this leaves my hair soft, it just doesn't feel moisturized.  I'm also surprised at the scent.  I expected something more light or refreshing but this shampoo smells like patchouli/sandalwood/eucalyptus, or a '60's head shop.  Having grown up in the 60's I don't mind the scent, but it wasn't what I was wanted. Wont reorder and will stick with OGX.",3
So glad that I found this item. I HATE the Listerine caps.  They can be so difficult to open (I don't know why everything needs to be &#34;childproof&#34; but that's a whole other discussion).  This allows the liquid to be dispensed without a fight.,5
"what the heck is it?  this corn is blue corn, hope you like blue stains all over everything including your mouth.  That's if you do not mind trying to bite into after cooking it to make it soft enough to eat.  Good Luck with that.  Bought it as blue corn is supposed to help with cholesterol.  With this you may get better cholesterol and lose your teeth.",1
Just as descdribed,5
Loved it! Put it on the front and lokked fab!,5
Very nice shiny synthetic hair. Only draw back is it tangles a lot. Nice headbands came with it.,5
"I love it , first time purchase  of this product left my hair soft and enhanced my natural hair  with leaving it crunchy",5
These sold for 9.00 during closeout on perfectly posh.com this is against p&p to sell something way over the cost of the product,1
Didn't fit well keep falling off while using.,3
Great prod. Easy to use stays on all day.,5
"My Philips razor blades have become dull over a few years use and this replacement set looks exactly like the original. Easy to install, and shaving turns to more smoothly and quietly, no more beard stubble",5
I liked that the sun protection is strong but I do not like that if I sweat then my skin is not able to breathe my face seems to over sweat AND after it's on I look like all the blood drained from my face.. almost sickly. The white cast I don't like.,3
Have enjoyed their soap for years.,5
Has no whitening capabilities. Been using it for 2 months twice a day and I see no difference.,1
Just like the picture,5
"Great color, definitely not waterproof if you use oils, etc. on your face.",4
good shampoo for fine hair.  for extra moisturizing,5
Great for big toes nails,5
This was the WORST hair I’ve ever bought!!!  HORRIBLE,1
Easy and convenient,5
does a good job,5
"Works just like any other facial wash I’ve used in the past. Is it worth $20? Not at all when you can get the same results with something cheaper. Also it does not foam like soap, it feels and washes like a lotion type cleanser.<br /><br />I can’t stand advertisements that say<br />“ reduces or eliminates pores”  nothing in this world will reduce or change them. They may clean them but that’s it... it just sounds good when someone is selling a product. Do your research and you’ll see.<br /><br />I didn’t have any bad reactions using this, not yet anyways. Makes my skin feel clean. This is no miracle in a jar, so I haven’t noticed it reduces any fine lines or wrinkles on my face. I’ll use it until it’s gone but I won’t be repurchasing unless it drops in price to $10 or below. The bottle is small.",3
"A little about me- I am late 30's and have pretty good skin just looking for something to delay the aging process.I had purchased the entire obagi line and was starting to use it but hated how it made me so dry and flaky- with spring coming on I was wanting to start tanning and couldnt do that while using Obagi- it was a pretty hefty investment for that skin care line but thought maybe I would put it up until the winter and wanted to try something that would work with me tanning and didnt want to spend 400 on a skin care system without trying it out first and bought this starter set- I am in love! I have used it for 4 days now and can see a huge improvment in my skin- I have lready started ordering the full size products and not sure if I will ever use the obagi or not now- after using the obagi my skin was dry, peeling and I was getting lots of balckheads - after using eminece for just a few days- all blackheads are gone- my skin is softer than it has ever been and has a helthy glow -",5
I love this product! Always a great purchase !,5
i love all the color changing vibrant colors,5
Love these,5
Good price. The kids loved them,5
So itchy that I return it,1
After a month of testing out I have no more black circles and puffiness is gone also. Every week got better and better. I am addicted to this new product. Will order again and again Great gift too Bonus smell great and moisture,1
Lots of tools for a good prive,5
"I LOVE these hair clips but they are not as sturdy as I was hoping. I don't use them every day, and hope they last.",4
"I was so excited to use these products, but was very disappointed - the eye liner does not stay on your eyes and what does stay, the eyelashes DO NOT attach to!! :(<br /><br />When I asked for a refund I was told I needed to return the product to KOREA!!!! The alternative was to have half the purchase price credited and keep the product. This was not the outcome I expected since the order was fulfilled by Amazon!!<br /><br />Very dissapointed!",1
"This is alright.<br />I thought it would be like my previous trimmer but have the vacuum so I don't make a mess.<br /><br />Turns out the vacuum is a great feature but it doesn't cut as well as my  beard trimmer.<br /><br />Overall I use this for a quick trim on an existing beard, but I still use my old plain ""vanilla"" Norelco for making straight lines around the beard/ears etc.",2
"Doesn’t feel like gel polish, takes forever to cure, and the “top coat” doesn’t leave that gel shine. This might be regular polish in a gel bottle or a really thin batch",2
Really nice and they are flexible to arrange as needed.,4
"* I received this item at a heavy discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review*<br /><br />At first I was unsure about this product. I opened it up and it looks like whipped mashed potatoes which is a little odd and didn't really smell like anything (it's unscented which is good); not pleasant or unpleasant. I decided to try it on myself first before trying it on my child. When the seasons change I get super bad dry skin on the tops of my hands that ends up itching, burning, and becoming scaly. As the weather has been cold the last week, my hands started to flare up. It only took TWO applications of this in one day to stop the itch and burning and start to heal my skin.<br /><br />I used it for my daughter the first time this week as well and after one overnight after the cream, the slight redness she had was gone. I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing more in the future!<br /><br />Best features:<br />Huge container<br />Works fast<br />Super moisturizing<br /><br />Possible improvements:<br />It is slightly oily until it soaks in and dries<br />Scent (maybe something natural like coconut oil would help this?)",5
Great!,5
"Gummy, too opaque. Threw it in the Bad Foundation Bin.",1
Feels great on my skin and didn't make my skin break out.,5
I like that this is cordless amd portable but it’s hard to hold and use because the iron is so wide and thick.,2
These go on with a little effort- need plenty of water and pressure- but once they are on they stay on. The kids loved all the different types of tattoos.,5
"I got this razor for my daughter but ended up keeping it because I liked it so much. First of all the handle is a heavy duty handle with some weight to it . I like that. It also has a magnetic feature to change the blades . I was worried it would fall off when shaving but it stood firm. The magnetic feature makes it super easy to change heads. Unfortunately I didn’t  see any replacement heads to order on Amazon. I would have liked the kit to come with more heads,  it comes with two, one to use and one replacement . I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it’s just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use. It also comes with a ceramic base to hold it . It looks great and simple while being stored.",4
I love the color of this lipstick. It is lightweight and goes on easily. I don’t feel it is incredibly moisturizing  . It also doesn’t last very long . I had to keep reapplying it throughout the day. With all the long wearing lip colors out there now this wouldn’t be high on my list of preferred lipstick. The shape is weird and uncomfortable to hold. It looks cool but practicality is more important to me .,3
I really like this lip gloss. It has a smooth application. The color is shimmery and pretty .,5
"This is a smooth makeup that goes on light and airy.  It is medium to light.  It has an overall natural look amd feel.I love the makeup cushion , it makes application a breeze.",5
"Good hold, workable wax. It has a slight pleasant scent and I like that you can turn the nozzle in two directions to get the spray pattern you prefer depending on the style you are looking for.",5
"High quality tools, just like your dentist uses.  They come with a storage bag and also a a nice cardboard tube.",5
This is a complete set for doing manicures or pedicures and even a couple for extra things like maybe for your face. All the tools are strong amd sturdy. The case unfortunately is not as strong. The straps that hold the implements in the case  are weak and thin and one broke right away. Overall a good set they definitely thought of everything to include in the kit.,4
Great size for purse or travel. Nice that it has a flip top for ease of use. This dries fairly quickly on your hands it’s a nice gel consistency however I’m not so  fond of the smell it’s not bad it’s just not a pretty smell. But men would probably be happy it doesn’t have a feminine smell. It’s hard to describe it kind of smells like a plant or something. Not bad just different . Does not leave my hands sticky - I actually like how my hands feel after using it .,4
This set of fillable bottles is good quality. I put hand sanitizer in them and they did not leak. They are easy to squeeze and I like the flip top. The 2 oz size is perfect for a weekend away for toiletries.,5
This deodorant goes on smooth. It has a full lavender scent. It's deodorant qualities are good.  the product controls odors all day. I find it non irritating and happy it doesn't have aluminum in it.,4
"I tried these strips and they did not stick well, they popped off so I REALLY my face and put toner on and they still popped off. Not a big fan of this product.",2
"I was not impressed with this when I first received it. The package looked old and faded. However when I opened it and used the eyelash curler I was very impressed. The curler worked quickly and easily , it was comfortable and easy to use- my lashes curled well with one squeeze. It comes with two extra pads for the curler.  The mascara wand is small and is able to get every lash. I was told the mascara makes my lashes look very natural-  of clumpy. The mascara really lengthened my lashes.",4
"This is a good water flosser . I’m comparing it to others I have owned. The last one I had did not last long- this appears to be better made and it just looks nicer overall. The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren’t careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a “massage “ button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen . It is easy and does a great job cleaning .<br />* If you found this review helpful please click the button below to let Amazon know. Thanks !",4
"I love that the toner is in a spray bottle. I wish the instructions were in A bit more clear.  I do not know if you are supposed to spray it on your face and go or use a cotton pad. I do not feel a tightening on my skin like most toners. It leaves my skin soft and it smells wonderful!  I have just been spraying it on my face after washing and I like that it’s easier, quicker and less waste when you don’t need a cotton pad.",4
"It feels more like shampoo, and the pump does not extend past the chubby bottle, so it is poorly designed for easy use. Seems like an easy fix. It seems so much like shampoo that I'm going to try it the next time I'm in the shower, maybe there is a way to save this purchase.<br /><br />Pros: Smells great.",3
"You're viewing products that are larger- a 3 oz. product, and then you run past this; but these are 1.75, so you are getting 3.5 oz for $20. You can get 3 oz for $15 without even looking that hard. So you are paying $5 for that extra half ounce.",2
best hair...2nd time purchasing. no complaints,5
I put my charcoal soap on there and with the brush it doesn't take much to get a good lather. This helps get all my makeup off easily. These are a good bang for your buck.,5
Helps so your glasses doesn't fog up.,4
I like that the masks have a “wire” on the top. That way you can contour the shape of the mask to your face so it is snug. The price is a bit high for only 10 masks.,4
Did not work,1
My niece and daughter love this curling wand.,5
Nice material and colors. But size imperfects (band to tight).,2
"Just what I wanted, some colors take longer to arrive but it’s worth the wait. Order before you run out.",5
"This is an exclusive product in that I moved from one are to another state and could not find this product well until I looked online. Well I’m going to stock up now. Very good product. I would search again. The texture is good , it’s waterproof (most other brands are not). Highly recommend it.",5
This book is such a great read!  I ordered it for class and really enjoy reading it outside of our assigned readings each week.  I can praise the authors enough for making it easy to understand and providing many helpful strategies to collaborating with others.  The book arrived with lightning speed and is all that the seller stated it would be.  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.,5
Great product,5
These are so heavy they will not stay in and they leave a crease. Velcro rollers much better.,1
I had a professional put these in and they fall out. I don't think it's 100% human hair either like they said. It tangles and knots .,2
Falling off after 1 day of wear the melody Susie in the pink bottles lasts for 2 weeks but not this melody Susie polish in the small white bottles,1
Love These brushes.  Very gentle on the scalp. I recommend,5
"Works fantastic, I think it would fit almost any dryer because it's flexible and molds to the shape of your dryer.",5
These are fantastic. Super scrubby and durable. Not for those who are sensitive.,5
"That's a good product, good quality, and good value.<br />I like to create my own formulas with no chemicals.<br />I fill up the bottles with goodies. Non-harmfull cleaning mixtures, natural anti mosquitos,  natural odors, and natural hand sanitizers.<br />The size is perfect for traveling and is very easy to hold.",5
"It was made with love, It was nicely packed, and the quality is good. There is only one problem: This is not magnetic eyelashes since you need glue to put them on. The only magnetic parts are the baby lashes. The baby lashes are very small pieces, groups of 3 singles lashes, that you can add on the main lashes after you applied them with glue. But the whole point with magnetic eyelashes is to not use anything! just your natural lashes as a sandwich.<br />I have returned them, sorry!",3
Too light,2
"Eeeeeeekkk I'm so excited about this!! I love my Dry Bar Buttercup hair dryer, but really wanted a diffuser for it because I like to scrunch my hair time to time. When I added it to my cart, it was $21 I believe. That's still cheaper than Sephora so I was going to get it but waited. SO GLAD I DID. Randomly, it dropped to $12.12!!!! Purchased immediately!!<br /><br />It fits my hair dryer perfectly. But, I can tell by looking at it that my hair dryer isn't a standard size on the end so I had to purchase the Bio Ionic brand since that's who makes my hair dryer. Worth it! It says universal, but I would still take measurements to make sure it'll fit yours if it isn't a Bio Ionic brand because they are not ever all universal.<br /><br />The part that attaches to your hair dryer is not a hard plastic- it is rubbery (but firm) so it slides onto your hair dryer but doesn't &#34;click&#34; into place. I think that's why they say it's universal because this allows for some difference in the size of your dryer. But still do your research and compare your hair dryer to the size of the Buttercup hair dryer because it fits it perfectly.<br /><br />You can also twist the diffuser to open up the vents or close them to control the air flow (see pictures). There will always be air flow on the outer ring of the diffuser, but you can completely close off the center, which is nice if you don't want a ton of force.<br /><br />I love it and it was completely worth it!",5
"This is a great spatula and plate deal. It's small enough to not need much space but big enough for what I needed it for. I was in the process of de-potting my lipsticks, and I used this to place them on while I worked, to keep things sanitary. Cleans up perfectly with alcohol. Mine came in perfect condition, not at all scratched like you can read in some reviews for these. I use this day to day when I need to lay out some foundation for application or to put some powder on before applying to my face. It keeps all of my bottles from being contaminated when applying product. It's been a wonderful addition to my kit!<br /><br />Edited to add: I noticed that there are many reviews on here that are coming from people that have gotten this discounted/free in exchange for a review. I am NOT one of those people. I purchased this on my own, with my own money, because I needed a spatula and plate to use for cosmetics. So, please trust that my review is honest and give it a &#34;YES&#34; for helpfulness! Thanks so much!",5
Love,5
Product was dried up .,1
Happy with this item,5
They work but not a neccessity.,4
Makes you feel clean.,3
"I’m not great at eyeliner, but luminaglow makes a cat eye super easy. The dual tips are moist and precise resulting in smooth, bold lines. It lasts all night for me. Even though it’s more expensive than drugstore brands, you will be glad you ordered this.",5
"The tips are silicone so they don’t actually absorb anything. I was hoping to use these for makeup, but they just smudge product around.  Definitely not good for ear wax removal either. They are super easy to clean and durable, but sadly I wouldn’t recommend these.",2
It is a great product.,5
"Oh my folks, don’t make the silly mistake , I did. I am still waiting for my mirror.  It’s been, darn near a month. Couple of days and it will be.  GGOOD GRIEF, I WANTED TO CANCEL,  FEELS LIKE A YEAR AGO!! Don’t buy the mirror. Buy, from someone else!!!!",1
Very easy to use and works great!!!!,5
Magnet is very weak. I definitely overpaid this item is worth about 59cents during back to school sales. Fell off locker door and broke as soon I used it. What a joke,2
Have already written a few words about St Ives. I use all of their products and do recommend this one as well.,5
These are great! They are glass so be careful. On my second set now because I am clumsy but I love how sturdy they are. :),5
Not the typical snappy bun maker I'm used too. Was hoping the price was a deal but the price is cheaper because the product is cheaper. Not quality at all. Won't buy again or recommend.,2
My hair is shoulder length. I cannot get any of it to stay on the wand. Nothing to hold it in place except your fingers which doesn't work very good. Total waste of money.,1
I love them,5
Does it's job but the belt loosens and twists. If the belt was thicker it would be better.,4
It makes your skin feel so soft. I use it on my hands too. It's only $9.99 so don't buy it here ask a friend to get you some if you don't live near a TJ's bc it's not worth the $26+ pricetag. I have sensitive skin and it works well for me. In the summer I just use it without anything else.,5
dindnt like it to watery not good you end up  wasting a lot of product,2
"The price made me purchase this.  the head and stand are amazing. Pretty much everything else but the needles were crap.  The thread almost like sewering thread and not the thicker weaving thread.  It kept breaking, so that sucked. Really don't like the cap either.  But, since I am new to wig making this was a great starter pack.  All in all the worth the purchase. gave me practice and now I know what to get and what not to get for my next wig.",4
The hurt my head and get in the way of my glasses.,2
It is a gift. Cute packaging.,5
Great soap! Smell is not too strong and lathers nicely.,5
Excellent at its job. Great contouring. Highly recommended at this awesome price!,5
This Bath Brush is perfect for use in the shower. The handle is the right length for getting enough pressure while washing your back. This is a quality product which should last for years. My wife loves that the bristles aren't to stiff. Thinking of getting another for the other shower.,5
Too expensive for what used to cost $1.00.,5
Wires come out,1
poor quality- flimsy,1
These are nice looking but way to soft to grab any makeup oonto the brush itself.<br /><br />I give them a 1 Star.,1
"Pros:<br />-Keeps my pens secured in my lab coat chest pocket even if I do a forward bend<br />-2 big pockets can keep all the pens, pencils, markers, hemostats that I need<br />-can stash a card or money in the very front pocket with the fold<br />-clip is a nice touch if you need to hang a key on it (I don't)<br />-comes with 2 velcro attachments for pens if you need it, they can be adjusted to fit where you want<br />-good price, fast arrival<br />-keeps items from falling through the seams of my pocket (old lab coats, y'know)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-there were some extra, loose stitching on mine. I haven't pulled it off...i just ignored it coz I don't want to risk having the stitching to completely come lose",4
Doesn’t hot enough. Poor quality.,1
Would be better if it had lace. I have to wear it with a hat cause the hairline is bad. But the rest of it is cute.,4
"Smells alright, not my fave. I had the pink one before and like that scent better. This causes my armpits to stink if I sweat heavily. The pink one seemed to work ok for me. I have since switched brands and notice that even on a heavy sweating day the new brand does not cause me to stink and actually lasts all day without reapplying! So I think this scent or the formula caused me to stink :(",2
I love them but my husband needs firm brushes for his teeth as he is hard on them. However no one makes firm natural brushes. I love that they have different colors and come in a minimal packaging box.,4
My hair didn't necessarily feel thicker --the feeling was more heaviness .  Nice after a shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is generally too soft and thin feeling so a little bit of heavy is appreciated.  Still looking for the miracle thick and heaviness for my shoulder length<br />soft and thin hair :0),4
I like the gentleness of the cloths and they do take off the make up easily.  The scent is nice for a  change.,5
The deep colors are bold and colorful.  The lighter colors are kind of bland (for my taste).  They hold long hair beautifully.,5
Caused a severe rash.  I thought it was my razor but it turns out it's the deodorant.,1
"This conditioner is top shelf the scent, the softness love the loose curls I wear an Afro really does my hair justice I’m 61 woo-whee loving it .",5
"Can't say much... Didn't buy this for myself... An older family friend was looking for one of these all over town and I used my account to introduce her to the wonders of Amazon. Haven't heard any complaints, so she must like it.",4
Not much more to say - this stuff will make you weak in the knees lol.  What did they put in this stuff - angel tears?!  Oh my freakin' God - my wife and I are absolutely in love with this stuff.,5
"Although these headbands are cute, they are very painful to wear behind the ears and the ribbon is already separated showing the material underneath, and my daughter tried to wear 3 of them only :( Complete disappointment.",1
Very elegant look for my bathroom and smells great!,5
Everything works great except the eyebrow trimmer which was a big reason I purchased it.  I can't type anymore because my eyebrow hair is in my eyes,4
"One of the best and most durable mouth guards that I have bought. I have tried many of them ,since having my new bridge put in and I use them so I don't grind my teeth at night. Most of the others that I have tried , split or grind down or fall apart and I have had this one for months and none of what has happened with the others has happened. And the fact that you get 2 for what I paid for one, is even better. You get 2 for the price of one and they last way longer than the expensive ones.",4
"I have to cut them way down, i guess that's better than the other way around but i thought it was really weird! I haven't gotten the hang of them yet either but i keep trying. Nice selection of lashes. The magnetic eyeliner works and is a little harder to take off but that's to be expected.",3
"This is a basic conditioner with a nice scent.  It is similar to Herbal Essense or VO5.  Not great, but good enough and looks nice with the full suite of amenities to accommodate vacation home guests.",3
These will work nicely at our vacation rentals.,3
Perfect,5
"Love these! I use them to make al natural pain lotion and other lotions, these are a sample size for people that aren’t sure if it works or not! (They always come back because it works!)",5
Love the product. Exactly as described.,5
"I never brush my hair, because, when I do, it just becomes a very frizzy mess. I was worried this brush was going to provide the same results. I'm happy to say, I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised by how well it actually worked! This set comes with two strong clips for helping you separate your hair and a cleaning brush.<br /><br />You'll need to start with clean, dry, and tangle-free ( as much as possible) hair for best results. If you want to change the temperature setting from Celsius to Fahrenheit just press down on both temperature buttons at the same time. Also, They have temperature recommendations based on hair types; 410°F-446°F (210°C~230°C) for fine hair.<br />374°F-410°F (190°C~210°C) for normal hair.<br />338°F-392°F (170°C~200°C) for soft hair.<br /><br />  What I really like about this brush:<br />1. It gives my hair a more natural-looking straight hair versus my flat iron.<br />2. It's very easy to use.<br />3. The bristles are very long which keeps the heating element away from your fragile scalp. I never felt my head get hot while using it.<br />4. I could safely and easily use this brush on my oldest daughter to tame her hair craziness. I wouldn't say that about my flat iron.<br />5. This brush would work for most hair types. My underneath layers of my hair are very thick, coarse, and extremely curly while the top layer is thinner, and just wavy.<br /><br />  My dislikes:<br />1. The control buttons are placed very inconveniently on the brush handle making it very difficult to not accidentally change setting while in use.<br />2. The bristles are long. This makes it safe to use, but difficult to tame those little flyaways that are very close to your head.<br /> 3. This isn't a problem for my hair, but from my use of this product I don't think it would work well for those that have spiral curls.<br />4. The back side of the brush also gets extremely hot; be careful!<br /><br />  Overall, I really like this brush and feel it is well worth it's price! I will still keep and use my flat iron for special events, but i know I will use this brush for everyday styling.<br />  I received this product in exchange for honest feedback. The opinions expressed in the review are solely mine.",5
Love these. They are perfect to take makeup off or wash your face. The cucumber is refreshing and smells amazing,5
Great value.. great material. A bunch of satin scrunchies for the cost of one at some stores. Soft material. Keeps my hair healthy,5
Quality and easy to use.,5
"I can’t say I was pain free, but last night was the first I did not wake in cronic pain. And was not stiff as a board getting up. I love the smell! It is not a fake rose scent. Guys may not appreciate it, but love the fresh smell of roses. I am sure it will take time to experience more pain relief.",5
Awesome Product,5
"the wig is uneven. one side is longer. not sure if its supposed to be that way. other than that, its fine",4
everything was going well until i got to step 4. the polish was gooey and hard to spread on the nail,4
Love this toothpaste!,5
"Super cute and perfect for stocking stuffers! My nieces had so much fun with them, I’ll definitely be ordering more.",5
No bangs on the product,1
"I have dry, flakey skin area, read the reviews, and thought I would give it a shot. It didn't work for me. The product goes on smooth but didn't clear up the flaky skin. No oily reside left behind",2
This is by far one of the best insulated tumblers I have ever owned.  I have hat hot coffee in it now for about 3 hours and it is still &#34;sip&#34; hot.  The outside of the container is cool to the touch.  Absolutely no heat transfer that I can tell.  My only complaint is the tops.  I would have liked to see one that is somewhat seal-able.  I have to take a star off for that but otherwise it is great.,4
Good product.,4
All fell apart within the first month of having them! Had to return them!,2
Very effective applicator.  Easy to clean.  Dispose as needed but I find they last a long time.,5
This finishing mineral powder is great -- you can use as much or as little as needed when applying with other Laura Mercier mineral products.,5
"First time I bought it, didn't work. Also had small hairs in package. Like short hairs. Exchanged it. Still didn't work. Tried with many batteries and nothing worked.",1
"I absolutely love these I’ve been using them for years and then one day I went to the store and they were no longer on the shelf, not sure why but I cannot find them in any store that I’ve gone to in the past two years or more. I was so happy to find them here I bought a few packs!<br />Also I don’t use them as hair rubber bands for ponytails my hair is really curly so I shake it out and put this on as if it’s a hairband and then let it fall into a ponytail to hold my curls up in a natural sort of ponytail I suppose but I love them",5
Great for the price. Not the best quality but they work and are cute.,5
17oz is he best spray ever and get a lot more water then usual,5
"The purple is like a violet color, and the length is great. Enjoyed it",5
"I recieved this My Best Beard Kit as a promotional item at no cost in return for a fair review.  I have been trying to find a good balm/oil/wax for my beard that didn't leave a residue and here it is!  Ive used Honest Amish, and a local beard oil, but my girlfriend didn't like the smell of the H.H. and the oil just wasn't enough to keep my beard in check.  This My Best Beard beard balm fits perfectly!  It has a nice smell and my girlfriend loves it too!  My beard is also noticeably softer after just a few days!  I really enjoy this beard balm and I plan on purchasing from PureSouth Naturals in the future.  The Beard brush that is included in this kit is also really nice.  I haven't had any bristles come out while using it and it feels nice on my beard.  Plus it comes with the nice carrying bag for when you go away from home!  Overall, this is definitely the best beard/balm/wax Ive used and I recommend it.",5
Made my hair look great,5
juat a good water bottle so many donthave a good spray this one does love the look,5
these brought many baths with great surprise inside my 9 yr old loved them,5
good price,5
I taught I was getting five the way they posted on line,5
I was excited to get these. But when I used them. They are completely watered down. The seller reached out to me and is returning my money. Although this unfortunate incident happened. I will continue to purchase other items from this seller as they were very professional and handled the matter quickly.,1
"I have to have infusions which causes my hair to  fall off. This is my savior (so to speak). My daughter suggested that I try it, and she bought my first set. I have seen the difference.  Now I have it on auto ship.",5
"I found this cream to be rather drying. Perhaps it's just me but I really wanted to like this after reading some of the reviews. If you have really dry skin perhaps this cream is not for you. It does come at a very affordable price though. The consistency is wonderful though and the ingredients are great. I would recommend this product for normal to perhaps dry skin but if you have a tendency towards very dry skin you may want to find something more hydrating.<br /><br />If this review is helpful to you, please click yes so it can be helpful to others as well. Thank you so much for reading!",3
Item was just as described!,5
Love that they are eco friendly!! Very nice tooth brushes! Will buy again 🙂,5
"Probably did nothing, beyond add layer of cream!",3
"This stuff is ok, but I'm looking for something that captures the spirit of New Mexico and this isn't it_ this stuff may be ok for a Texas Urban Cowboy but I need something that captures the essence of Leather, Whiskey, & Peppers",3
I’m so pleased with my Hearoo Hard Storage Carrier!  I leave it on my counter for laying my dryer in between uses!,5
Great Product.,5
"They aren't too long or too thick nor do they give the appearance of being fake eyelashes. If you don't want to put on individual lashes, these are PERFECT!",5
"It IS messy, but the results are worth it!",5
"This is a lightweight gel.  A bit sticky on the hands, but does a nice job.",4
"This is an attractive piece of jewelry but I haven't worn it yet because the catch is too small to see. I have to take it to a jeweler for a larger, easier catch.",3
Great scent. Nice face feel. Will buy again,5
The long lighter blonde pieces were stick straight.  No way to style to keep them from sticking out.  Made the hair piece look very cheap and fake.,1
Inexpensive and well made.,5
"These shower fizzies don't produce much scent. And, it's kind of difficult to figure out the correct location in the shower to make them work right. Too much water and they just wash down the drain. Too little water and they don't fizz at all.  I don't think that this is a bad product, compared to other 'shower bombs'. I just think that the whole concept of a shower bomb is probably bad.",1
"Okay, I'm getting old. So, yeah, my eyebrows are getting bushier and I have to trim the nostrils. I also have a beard, mustache and sideburns that need regular grooming between visits to the barber. I've tried other kits in the past. They either don't have the attachments to do the job, or just don't work well enough, period. This kit does it all and does it well. It's a regular traveling companion now, always in my toiletries bag. I'm very happy with this purchase, and highly recommend it.",5
It works for what I need it for,4
They would not work for me<br />I had to give it away<br />Not happy with them,1
Probably the best and most desirable asked for glitter. Add on to nail service.,5
These are awful. They dont stick to your face and the shapes of them are terriable.,1
"I have several Kneipp products that I purchased on Amazon and love all of them. This is my favorite shower foam and hope they continue to make it. I couldn’t find the other Kneipp shower foams I had purchased in the past and it looks like they have been replaced with bath oils. I have tried other shower foams but this is by far a superior product in every way. The foam is thick, rich and luxuriant. The scent is light and heavenly. Kneipp is a wonderful company from Bavaria, Germany. Kneipp products are not made in China. You will immediately notice the difference.",5
This is my favorite cuticle nipper tool. It's easy to hold and really sharp.,5
I was pleasantly surprised with this headband! So cute and fits my look. Def buying other colors!,5
Didnt stay on more than a couple hours. But super cute,2
"Doesnt cover tattoos, doesnt stay. not worth the waste of time or money. maybe as foundation it works but not for covering anything important for more than 5 minutes",1
I use these to cut hair and I have no complaints.,5
It is a gift so I won't know more about it until my niece opens it next weekend but I can't wait to see the reaction! The quality of the wig is fantastic! I was very impressed!,5
Thanks,5
These are nice bonnets for toddlers. My only negative thing about them is that it leaves a a mark from the pull string on my baby head.,5
"I love it! I have extraordinary thick hair. I’m also “natural”. So, this has been by far the best edge control to do my “Senegalese Twists” with.",5
The prude for fans fast and with multiple color clips. It works perfect for holding hair. They have not broken on skipped out of my hair when using.,5
"My second purchase of this item. I liked it so much, I bought a set for my daughter.",5
"Above average styling product and so happy to find on Amazon as I don't know where else you could purchase.  Does a great job to a needed lift.. Lift it, spray, give it a little attitude and you are on your way :-)",5
WOW these are GREAT.,5
"Havent quite gotten used to using this is full time. Tickles my lips. Lol.  But when I do use it, my teeth feel so polished clean.  Has several different settings. I havent used the face part of it.  A great price point!",5
"I love these. They are so soft and I get a lot of compliments from these. They stay on my head, they work perfectly. Would def recommend.",5
The coloring works more like blush than bronzer and applies very strong color that doesn't look great.,1
Does not cover up as well as I'd hoped based on previous reviews.,3
Worked fine.,4
Very pretty<br />Charm!,5
"I have had my shaver for a number of years and it still works great. I have (as my shaver gets older)had problems finding replacement parts but this is it. Fits great, works great, and i don't have to go from store to store looking for the right one. Shaver works just like new.",5
"I have received this wig for almost one month, i like  it! The black and red color is cute and quality is good too!",5
Smells nice to me.  And  not bad on the dry hands too,4
"This face mask didnt work like what I see in demonstrations on YouTube.  It work but much more slowly.  It burned<br />around the sides of my nose down by my mouth and after a couple of days made scabby tissue ,it was pretty raw. I guess I have sensitive skin.  I can use it but will avoid this super tender area. It worked to lighten the top of the nose blackheads. I definitely think 2 times a week is the max for using to avoid my issue.",3
"This is a very nice case, as you can see in the picture it holds  full size items. I haven't decided what all I want to put in it but when I do it holds plenty. It could be used for different purposes.",5
I love that this handy dandy eyelash dryer is rechargeable. So when I received this I was sceptical.  So I put my mascara on put this at the base of my lash and turned it on while pushing my eyelash up gently.  Warm air gently dried them curled up. It shut off when finished.  No hard squeeze with an eyelash curler needed ! This tool gently does the job. I love this tool. Easy to hold and use.,5
"Ive been ordering glass bottles and moving my products into them. I get refill size and transfer.  These 2 spray bottles were a little thinne not bad, but still sturdy enough and the spray top where the sprayer is spins loosely 360 degrees.  ?? I just filled it with my gallon of orange cleaner and I had to take off the sprayer and toss it in the garbage!  The flaw is the spinning sprayer that allowed my expensive orange cleaner to pour out of the top all around the nozzle.  cheaply made  but all in all a good glass bottle with a terrible srayer . If you just need a bottle with a screw top your good. If you have a different sprayer you can take off a plastic bottle great. Thats what I did. I took the label off my orange cleaner and stuck it on this bottle and it looks so nice. So my sprayer and label made a great usable bottle.",4
"I'm replacing all my pump and spray bottles with these beautiful cobalt blue<br />glass bottles. The sprayer version is easy to hold and spray.  The sprayer is top notch even better than I was expecting . I filled one with my zero odor and I get a great fine mist . No drips or wet floor. I took the sticker off the plastic bottle and put it on my glass bottle. It came with a chalkboard type label, but I wanted my lable on this one.",5
"I like this product a lot.  Good color and blends right into my hair. It even colors my greys ,it rubs color into them that was a surprise to me . Ive had an inch of grey and when Ive been hiding a bald spot or thinning spots it just deposits color right into my hair. Woohoo . these products are a little itchy when they get on your scalp.",4
So far I havent seen a change. Sometimes I feel rush when ask for a review for skin or haircare. Takes time to see growth or reduced wrinkles. Please dont rush us . If I see results in the future I will edit my review. Thanks,3
"Feels very nice , the scent is a bit earthy which I much prefer to perfumy",4
"the color of this make is so unreal I couldnt believe it. the price was good so I ordered it, I went back and looked at all of the shades and none of them look real also really light I am a light blonde and I still looked like the bride of frankenstien not worth the money to send back they need to fix the colors to human shades the mineral veil is nice will buy again sorry",1
"I've read all the positive reviews. For use,, gentle, sensitive, all skin types. That's not true.  I can't use this because it contains coconut, Cocamidopropyl Betaine. There's alot of lotions, creams, gels; that say for sensitive skin. Even for skin that sufferers from conditions. I'm allergic to coconut. That means any products that use coconut additives, I'm allergic too. And my face gets a severe burn. I think this would be perfect, if coconut additives weren't added.",1
"Use this daily. Soft on skin. I have sensitive skin. It's not rough. It's soft. Use it to remove waterproof eye make up, lip stick and even nail polish. Its better than regular cotton balls, toilet paper or paper towels.",5
"A bit duller than expected, especially after a couple weeks of use.",4
"I'm bought this to try and regrow thinning brows. I've been using it for a week, I don't see even one tiny hair growing back; however, it can take longer than that, so if hair does grow back in a few weeks or months I'll definitely come back and update my review.",3
"Such a cute soap with lovely design, scent and color, perfect for what I was looking for, which was more of a display item in the bathroom. They're a bit small, but come 3 to a box. Really love them. I'd love to use them as a soap, especially since they're made of natural products and used for exfoliating, but they're so pretty! lol",5
Perfect to protect my hair,5
Great value for quality loofas!,4
Control paste is great for grabbing those edges together.  The fragrance is outstanding,5
Works just like the original.,5
Exactly as expected... Just different package and container...I am HAPPY,5
"Good stuff, thanks!!",5
"I recently acquired a flat iron and wanted clips like these to section and hold my daughter's hair while we used the flat iron. These are well-made in friendly colors, and they're nicely curved rather than straight. The jaws hold well but aren't too strong. Really an ideal solution and at a great price, too.",5
"Doesnt last as long. But i guess its because this is more natural and less damaging to health .  Would buy it again and use everyday ,but on my sweaty days i prefer my regular nivea roll on",3
"I bought these and to say I'm disappointed is an understatement!  Only one is the color I expected while the other two were faded with a pink tone while the other is almost a lavender pink!  Which needless to say is the one on the right!  I don't know what I'm going to do because I was supposed to go out to an event with my husband and can't order more until the refund has been granted!  The quality of the hair is fine but the color is ALLL over the place!  So be very careful when ordering, making sure you give yourself enough time for plan B, if plan A decides to turn into a Coachella festival and party without YOU!!!",1
Amazing!!!! I have a problem area near my front teeth with plaque and this thing scraped it right off super easy!!,5
Well no reason to get into the plunger which we all know is useless but the packaging was good and no breaks. I was using Meaningful beauty and it made my face a greasy mess! I found this after searching for dark spot help. Since i turned 38 i have noticed dark looking spots on the top of my cheekbones. Im sure its from years of outdoor sun and tanning bed periodically in my 20s. Really didnt care about the long term effects. Now im dealing with that and redness on my entire face. I've been using this for about 3 days now after a shower when my pores are opened. I can't say i have seen any results yet but of course its too soon. I can tell you that this does not leave my face oily at all! Skin feels cool and dry after immediate use. I really hope this works for me. I really wouldn't care how much it costs as long as it works but the price is awesome! I will update after 1 month. I didnt realize you need to use it 2 times daily so i will start with that tomorrow. High hopes!,4
This is a beautiful dark purple leaf crown with rose gold metal. It fits my female adult head nicely and that was after I bent it to make it smaller. It wouldn’t fit a small child. My 4 year old daughter was very disappointed that it didn’t fit her. It came quickly and I’m surprised it was damaged due to the lack of product protection. It is well made and a fun addition to anyone's dress up collection!,4
"I searched the EWG website for this company and product and in many spelling varieties and came up empty handed. If this product was indeed EWG verified, it would not only be on the website but it would have the EWG logo on the product plus it wouldn’t have linalool which is high on the allergy list.<br /><br />Other than the linalool, this has decent ingredients. It is silicone free, paraben free, sulfate free and alcohol free. I would stay away from this product if you have malassezia (fungal) acne as olive and japonica may be triggers and/or pore clogging.<br /><br />Like all natural bar shampoos, it won’t lather like traditional synthetic shampoos but it does clean. It takes some getting use too and a period of detoxing for your hair to get use to the change in chemicals if you are switching from synthetic to natural but it is worth it!<br /><br />I would recommend this shampoo bar however I am rather concerned about the EWG verified claim.",3
These are cute and my 4 year old daughter loves them. They come in bright colors however a handful do them has creases wings and I’m not really sure how to get the crease out.,4
This is a cute bow and is exactly what is advertised. I do believe the $10 price point is pretty high considering you can get 10 headbands for $12. It is well made and fits my 4 year old daughter’s head nicely.,4
This is a pretty bow however $7 for one bow is pretty expensive considering I can get 10 of these bows for $8 from other sellers.,4
"I got the brown with ginger and has zero ginger in it which is a plus for me since neither do I. I have wavy, thin hair so it’s always hard to find extensions that match my hair wave. I hate using heat products so in order to use most extensions, I have to straighten my hair which I don’t like. I just need some volume, not length so I cut these which was really easy. All you need is a sharp pair of hair cutting scissors and a pony tail holder. Put the pony tail holder where you went to cut and cut away. It isn’t a perfect like which is good to help blend.",5
"These are a great idea but only if you have nice long, thick hair. I have fine hair and it looks really silly.",3
These are pretty and very soft brushes that are the perfect size. They are lightweight and easy to use.,5
Halo extensions just don’t work for the shape of my head apparently. I’ve watched countless videos on how to properly put on and I can’t get it right for the life of me. I honestly think my head is just a strange shape or something. The extensions are beautiful and nicely made.,4
"These are easy to apply though they did slide down a small amount because I can’t sit still for 20 minutes (thanks kids!). I have no idea the ingredients which is dangerous for people that suffer from allergies or sensitive skin. Lucky for me, I didn’t have any reactions and kept on for 15 minutes however I didn’t see any changes from using this product. They are cold which felt nice under my eyes but nothing more. I’ll pass on these.",3
"I absolutely love this beauty line! Most products are EWG certified and good for your skin! It is amazing the nasty chemicals in popular cosmetics from causing cancer to fertility issues so do your research. Learn what you want in a product, including environmentally, and what works for your skin.",5
"I have very light eyebrows (thanks genetics!) so I always darken my eye browns slightly with a little brown eye shadow so I thought I’d try this. It is waterproof but does easily rub off skin with some water if you don’t let it sit for awhile. Once it’s dried, it stays on pretty well. I ordered brown since I have light brown hair but this is a very dark brown so it gave a rather dramatic and sinister look lol I don’t think I’ll be using this. The tips of the eyebrow brush is rather bendable so you can go from 3 small, thin lines to 1 thick line VERY quickly.",4
These headbands are as advertised and lightweight.,4
"This is a super fun dress up wig! It is well made, soft and beautiful. It fits well and stays in place with the extra strap. It weighs 251g which is about the same weight as 100 pennies so very light weight.",4
I am impressed with the feel of this wig! I got this wig for my daughter to play dress up with her friends because I they MUST have “princess hair” and this didn’t disappoint! It feels like real hair and weights 305g so it weights the same of about 122 pennies.,5
These are perfect for traveling due to the short handle and protective case. The bristles are soft and the handles are sturdy.,5
I got this for my headband-loving almost 6 year old niece and it is adorable! It is a little tight on her head and weights 3.73oz which is about the weight of 42 pennies. The gems appear to be made of glass and held onto the headband with clear thread and glue.,5
"These feel so good during shampooing! I love going to the salon to get my haircut because they always give such a great scalp massage. Although this isn’t a profession scalp massage, it does feel great! It also helps the shampoo get onto the roots and really clean your scalp. They fit nicely in the palm of my hand and even my kids and husband love using them!",5
"The list of ingredients isn’t in English which is a big thing for me as I am sensitive to certain products. The ones that are in English, Solanum Melongena which is an eggplant extract, EDTA which is a chelating agent and not good for you at all, Camellia Sinensis Leaf which is a skin conditioner and perfume and CI 77492 which is a synthetic cosmetic colorant. There is a -20 which typically is a PEG which Polyethylene Glycol and can cause health issues if used in excess.<br /><br />The application of the product itself is a neat concept and makes applying a mask much easier. There are unnecessary perfumes and colors in this product along with EDTA and possibly PEG which I stay away from.<br /><br />Learn your skin and what it can handle also what you are looking for in a skin. This is not a natural product by any stretch of the imagination.",3
I had a set of headbands JUST like these in the 90s so I had to order them for my 3 year old daughter. They are made of satin and your typical headbands.,5
"Overall, this product isn’t horrible compared to others on the market. It is paraben-free, sulfate-free, EU Allergen free and uses minimal ingredients however it also contains alcohol, silicone and is not safe for fungal acne.  After running this product through a cosmetic ingredient safety checker, it scored an 88% one the EWG Health Rating.  Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered “moderate risk” mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat. (Bad for dry skin, bad for sensitive skin, potentially block pores) and BHT (also found in edibles, rubber products and is banned in UK and EU due to limited research showing BHT is linked to cancer). This product is good for brightening, anti-aging and promotes wound healing.  It also contains steric acid which can potentially block pores.<br /><br />Keep in mind, everyone’s skin is different and what effects one person may not effect another. Learn your skin and what products work best for you. Personally, I would stay away from this product if you have very dry skin and/or sensitive skin. I have “normal” skin (no sensitivities, not overly dry or oily, limited acne, no allergies) and didn’t have any issues with this product so far. It has a light scent that isn’t overpowering but completely unnecessary (I HATE fragrance in beauty products; stick with essential oils). It absorbed nicely and didn’t leave my face feeling oily. I am giving this product 4 stars as of February 21, 2021 due to the minimal ingredients and will update this review once a larger amount of time has passed to fully understand how to works with my skin.",4
This product is tacky so it has a good hold if that is what you are looking for. The scent is “manly” with a slight smell of cedar with a slight shine.,4
"Finally, I am able to do my own manicure at home. I call it the cheese grater..lol but it's really not abrasive at all. I soak my feet in water for 10min, then I use the big foot scrubber to remove the hard dead skin on my heels and top inside sides. It works great. Does the job. Then I finish off with coconut oil that I purchased from amazon.<br />Leaves my feet feeling soft. So glad I got this. Overall, easy to use, durable and works great.",5
"ordered and received: SILVER<br />Perfect for Halloween this year. I am starting to get props ready and needed a white wig. I'm going to grunge it up and make it look scary.<br />Great for Halloween costumes, Halloween props, and even Cosplay.<br />I recommend this wig for fun times. I would not wear it on a daily basis though. It's thin and tangles easily, making it great for Halloween. I'm excited to get to work on grunging it up.",4
"★ i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone in any way.<br />📌 UPDATE: 6/2/2016. I've had this product since January 13, 2016 and the beginning of this month the callus remover strip has start to break way. I would have updated earlier, but I forgot. I still use it and I still like it, but my 5 star has dropped to a 4 star because the longevity of the product. It probably should not be pulling away so soon. I keep it up right so it's not hitting any water after my shower.<br />-----<br />I have been so needing one of these. I have tried others but sad to say they were not as rough as this one and let me tell ya, I truly need a rough one. My feet are pretty dry. I love going for my pedicure's but the cost can add up. I would much rather just do it myself.<br /><br />So, needless to say, I got a chance to try this one out and I have to admit, it's &#34;great&#34; It's perfect for &#34;me&#34; I have a home pedicure system. I soaked my feet for thirty minutes then I took this wooden foot file and went to work on my super dry feet. WOW, it worked wonders.<br /><br />I was going to put a picture up, but I'm sure no one wants to see my callus feet with dead skin. That's just gross. As far as longevity, well, that's up to you. You can wash these with hot water, but after a while, you will need to throw it away and get a new one. As far a price does, I have seen this same size at a brand store for a few dollars less. But you will have to actually go to the store and buy it, when you can order right here on amazon<br /><br />❤️ PRO:<br />• it's large<br />• does good at removing tough dried skin<br /><br />💔 CONS:<br />• the suction does not hold<br /><br />✔️ Overall: It's a good callus remover. It works for me.",4
"Purchased for my 9 yr. old niece as a Christmas present, she loves it.  I had mistakenly ordered two and had planned to return one, but my other niece (hairdresser) saw it and bought it from me.<br />.",4
"[[VIDEOID:2f635dfbca733fd3206007b4e5b73198]] The liner was dry and I had to get a replacement.  So the lashes did not stick like I thought they should.  I AM A FIRST TIME USER OF LASHES. So I would have liked a tutorial on how to best use this product and a small plastic layer over my lashes to keep out bacteria, and how to clean the lashes, and a clear statement if they can be reused.  Also, work on the liner not drying out before I can use the product.",3
"I love this item but sometimes hard to clean.  Also, you should start at the ends and work yourself to the root.",4
"Didn't work for my man-bun that I gotta wear at work need the 3"" pins<br />Seemed okay otherwise",4
This is a perfect dupe for the J.Crew headband. I wear these all the time and they are perfect for the fall season.,5
2nd time ordering. Will continue to use. Great product and received fast.,5

Love it!,5
Don't know..it was an gift.,1
"This product is the first cleansing oil I've used on my face. I'm really enjoying it. It easily removes makeup and leaves me with a soft face and no break-outs after removing my make-up. My nineteen year old son, JUST came up to me and gave me a hug good-bye and commented on how soft my face was. True story! This hasn't happened before, and the only difference to my cleansing regimen has been this cleansing oil. So far I'm loving it. It easily and smoothly goes on my face and removes my make-up. The cleansing oil smells nice, it's using light, nice smelling oils and feels good on my face. I highly recommend it.",5
"I received my new Argan Oil shampoo and was super excited to start using it. I have thick natural, healthy, unprocessed shoulder length hair. What I noticed with this shampoo was first of all it took a lot of shampoo the first time I washed it (one of two times) to get my hair to lather. Since this is organic I was not surprise to find this, but disappointed that it seemed to take so much shampoo. My fix the second time I washed my hair was to use a different shampoo for the &#34;starter wash&#34; and to use the Argan oil for the final wash. I LOVE how the shampoo smells and how it looks when I've finished blow drying and styling my hair. My hair is quite thick and can get kind of frizzy and have fly aways which did not happen with this shampoo. Typically I cannot wash my hair everyday, as it usually takes a couple days for my hair to &#34;fall&#34; and not look so &#34;big&#34;. Fortunately, my hair looked great immediately with this new shampoo. I also washed my hair before a house party for New Years and had MANY compliments from various family members over the wonderful smell of my shampoo. Several requests were made by my mom, sister, sister in law and niece to tell them the name of my shampoo. It has a fresh spa like scent and appears to be a cross between a bit of honey and vanilla in the fragrance. I LOVE this shampoo and was very excited to have the opportunity to review this product for my unbiased opinion.",5
"My feet and my hands get dry and end up looking wrinkled and dry. I've tried lots of different products and I'm always on the look out for a good hand and foot moisturizer. This Shea Butter Hand Cream comes in a beautiful box that is tightly wrapped in plastic. When you open the jar you are greeted by a pleasant aroma - hard to describe, even though it says it has lavender as an ingredient I did not really smell lavender as a smell. The cream is thicker than normal hand lotion but not super thick and it does not feel greasy, it feels nice and quickly absorbs into your skin. I received this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion and really like this product. I especially love shea butter and that this shea butter hand cream is made of all natural ingredients.",5
This is a very nice comb and brush set. It works good on all types of hair. Use the comb on wet hair and use the brush on dry hair. The comb can also be used to clean out the hair from the brush.,5
This is a nice loofah. It is nice to wash your back with. I especially like that it comes with the bath mit as well as the back scratcher.,4
"I have type 3A hair (naturally curly, coarse and thick) cut into a pixie style. I wear my hair straight more often than not and blow dry with 2 different size round brushes. Since my roots are very curly, I need a smaller flat iron to get to the roots since my hair is short. I've tried using a regular size and it's too large to reach my roots. I've tried probably 6 different flat irons and this one I actually saw on an Instagram post. It doesn't have a temperature setting; you turn it on and that's it. However, this thing gets HOT! The way it feels in your hands is perfect, it's not awkward feeling. The fact the handle is a little thicker makes it easier to hold and it also has grooves so you're able to grip it well while straightening. This is the best flat iron for shorter hair styles!",5
"I'm in love with this hair trimmer. It works so well that I had to buy my mom one. It has attachments for getting those aggravating nose hairs and one for your hard to reach/tweeze hairs. It's not rough on your skin, glides easily, shaves off unwanted hair and gets those annoying nose hairs completely gone! I absolutely love this little trimmer! It's super easy to clean, small enough to carry in your purse, it's pain-free and keeps the hair gone for days! Thanks for making a great trimmer at a cheap price!",5
"Haven't used them yet, but thought they would be a bit bigger.",4
"Doesn't smell a lot like I had expected.  smell I mean, there was a faint scent, but I would have liked a little more.  The product did somewhat moisturized my skin.<br /><br />~UPDATE~<br />So, the seller reached out to me to correct this issue.  I was completely blown away by the service. I have purchased and reviewed many products on Amazon but I’d have to say this is the only seller that really wanted to rectify the “issue”. THANK YOU!<br /><br />With that, FIVE STARS! To me, customer service is everything! In fact, I may not have like the Watermelon, but I will try another scent!",5
This conditioner isn’t special in any way. It isn’t the best at conditioning and definitely isn’t chemical free. The only thing that is appealing about this stuff is the incredible fragrance.,4
The description list these as large and the are small and cheap. Not satisfied with this.,1
Works great but the smell isn't great.,3
As described,5
My children and I have very thick hair. My oldest daughter has locs and my second daughter has very very think super tight coils! These things are very thin which I wasn't expecting AND they break SO EASILY! If your hair is thin they might work but if you have thick hair DO NOT WASTE YOUR ENERGY on these!,3
Great value!,5
buy all the time<br />shipper was great,5
"Magnetic eyelashes are an interesting concept for those times you want a dramatic look but don't want the hassle of glue on lashes.  The magnetic liner works well but it must be applied pretty thick in order to give enough area for the lashes to stick.  You have to be careful when placing them also as  you cannot really adjust the position because pulling the lashes off usually tears the liner off with it, so you have to then clean the lashes and reapply liner if you make a mistake which is kind of a hassle.  The two lashes included here are nice but neither one really worked for my eye shape, I got another kit which had 7 different shapes in it and that one had two styles that work well for me so I would probably recommend getting one with more options to ensure you find one that fits your eye shape.",4
"This is a great deal on a kolinsky brush.. I'm an artist and have numerous other sable brushes, I was skeptical that this one would be real kolinsky hair at this price point but was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The quality of the hair and shaping of the brush head are both very nice.  The pointed filbert or cats tongue shape is versatile for creating thin lines or broader strokes.<br /><br />My only qualm with the brush is that the handle is a bit too short and I find it somewhat uncomfortable to use but this may or may not be an issue for you depending on how you like to  hold the brush",4
Not as good as expected is okay for price but nothing special,4
they come apt easy says supposewd tp be treted not treated  put in trash  garbage,1
Product photo shows a 15oz but it comes as like a 1.5 oz.,1
Great thanks!,5
It was ok. I needed a darker color and it only lasts 2 days,3
This great kit isn’t missing a manicure tool. Great for traveling.,5
Glides on with perfection!,5
Perfect for touch-ups between the salon,5
The horn and ears were flimsy but got the job done but I based my entire purchase on the Ballons.  The balloons that came with mine were minuscule and a waste.  They were super small and so heavy they need and stick and assembly to hold them upright.,1
A brush for everything!  Big brush my favorite for powder,4
"Not really a smell to it, its okay.  Keep me from being ashy.",3
Dear Barber is a MUST HAVE!,5
Absolutely  the worst hair I have ever purchased!  Used prior.  Must have got a return shipment,1
Not very moisturizing and real messy.,1
Aww dog hates being brushed. But this? He will sit there for hours. Amazing,5
I used this multiple times on different wood.  Didn't do anything for me.  Wish I had tried it before the return date passed.,1
Color is very different from pic. In pic it looks burgundy but in reality it's a light orange color. Pretty but not hardly what was expected.,2
Ok makeup color doesnt stay on long,4
"This isn’t the best facial hair remover I’ve ever used, but for the price it does a great JB.",4
So elegant,5
"I ordered several different body oils when I first discovered I was pregnant. The directions state to start using during your second trimester, but I started using this product immediately. Over the course of two months of daily use my existing scars started to fade and turn from silver to a much more natural tan color to match my olive skin. (These are very serious scars from being attacked by a box cutter about 8 years ago.) Bio Oil is evening out less substantial scars that weren't faded by Maderma. I'm now into my second trimester and my body is starting to grow. My old scars are continuing to fade substantially and I haven't developed a single stretch mark. I will write a follow up review regarding stretch marks in another three months when my pregnancy body is a bit more.... Yeah",5
"This flaked off, smudged and smeared after a couple hours as most all 2 step mascaras with fibers do for me. I'm not sure if it's the product or a user error. I put 2 coats of the sealer on but still flaked off. It looked good to start, but it didn't last. Reminded me of my last relationship. Started good and then ended in disappointment.",2
Great size! Perfect for gifts.,5
I use only a soft side of it.<br />Do not see how the other side<br />would be useful to me.<br />The reach is good and the quality<br />does not diminish with time.,4
"The problem with this product is that it flattens practically after<br />the first use. Another thing, the glue will not last for long.<br />But the concept is good. Two stars for that.",2
"I was disappointed when I received this. This heart-shaped hair donut  doesn't look nothing like in the picture. It's very thin. I thought it was made out of plastic but, it is made out of foam.",1
"It’s eh okay at best, definitely not smudge proof, easy to use, however it transferred very easily to my upper eyelid. The stamp though a good idea, if you have experience using just a felt tip, it does a much better job than the stamp. The lid came off the felt tip part and it doesn’t stay on.",4
Don't seem long enough but feel real,4
"Use once very cost, grind grain is bigger, make of body very painful. Didn't feel the moisturizing effect. But the price is very reasonabl",3
"I have thick loose wavy hair and I had damanged hair from the years of hair straighting and hard water. No conditioner or leave in treatments have been able to help restore my hair. It was at the point where I couldn’t even run my fingers through it without kinks. My hair felt like straw and always looked dry and frizzy no matter what I did to it. After using this, my hair feels amazing. Smooth and has a nice slip to it. No more kinks. I think the best part is that this doesn’t wash off. I’m not sure how many showers I have to go through before I have to reapply, but I can tell one tube will last me for a while. After you shower, grab enough of this to cover a thin layer in your hair and then blow dry. It will feel sticky and tacky but once your hair is completely dried, it will just feel like smooth silky hair. If you feel you put too much in one area, put some water in that area to thin the cream and then blow dry again.<br /><br />I really wish I found out about this product before I chopped off my hair. But seriously, wow! Amazing product. Instant and permanent! KBeauty has done it again.",5
This hair is so soft! I love it. It's real hair and you can tell.,5
"These little gems fit so well in your pocket. Have been filling them with sanitizer liquid from local Brewery- use a tiny funnel. Take them into every store we go to help spray down cart handles, door handles, ourselves.....Definitely needed these right now to help ward off the virus! Make sure you snap them shut!",5
Worked well on my long curly hair.,5
Love this. Wish there were instructions on how to use it. A little trial and error to get it to the temp I need and how thick or thin to spread it on.  Easy to use.,5
"Very thin, bent. The kids will like it, but cannot recommend.  We added alligator clips and beads to them.",3
Pleased with purchase,5
The Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Dual Action Toner is best used after face has been washed to remove the excess oil and persperation. The product is then absorbed on cotton and run on facial surface.,5
"bought these to embroider for stocky stuffers, came super fast the colors are excellent",5
They break and separate as soon as u put them on your finger tips. So annoyed.,1
Yessss hunnyyyyy so cute PERFECT! I give it a 10/10,5
The scent is very nice and the liquid-creamy soap is great.,4
This is great stuff. I will buy this again. My skin was sooooo soft.,5
"I don't know anything about the other reviews that talk about the original Salux from Japan versus impostors from China.  I've never owned a product like this before.  I am male and have sensitive skin that's prone to irritation that results in random pores getting clogged on my arms or chest or legs.  I bought these on a recommendation to test out and see if they helped.  I've only had them for a few days, and can't really say yet if they've done anything for my pores or not, but they do seem to be doing a really good job at exfoliating my skin.<br /><br />The individual towels are roughly 12 inches wide by 24 or 30 inches long.  They're made of some sort of woven nylon or plastic material that is kind of wavy and extremely abrasive when rubbed across the skin.  You use the towel by putting a dollop of liquid soap onto it and then rubbing it onto your body to create a lather.  The towel is long enough that you can easily scrub your back by holding the ends of the towel and pulling back and forth.  The towels are abrasive enough that it really feels like you're scraping a layer of skin off.  Probably not appropriate for use anywhere sensitive.<br /><br />I'm loving these so far.  Highly recommended.",4
The bristles fall out like crazy so it can potentially ruin your dip powder look.,1
"Box and plastic wrapper intact, glass shattered and liquid soaked into box. Too dangerous to try to return. My money was wasted.",1
"Did not work at all. Trying it different ways, it felt like it was just scraping my face or going to rip my skin off, but did nothing for the blackheads or clogged pores, even after prep to open pores.",1
"For the price, this is an excellent basic electric toothbrush and flosser. The two pieces lack the fancy features of more expensive pieces, but my dentist says all those extra features are not worth the money. The toothbrush works great and the only feature my dentist recommends is the 2 minute timer to make sure you give yourself enough time to brush all your teeth. I've always used string floss in the past, but this water flosser seems to work just as well most of the time. Sometimes there is some food stuck in my teeth that I still have to use the string for.<br /><br />As I said, features are minimal. There is 1 charger for both devices, so you can't use the charger as a stand for both items. Instead of all the cardboard in the box, why not include a cheap plastic tray or stand? There also is no travel case, just a little cover for the toothbrush head. I would really prefer a full length hard case to be included instead of having to buy an aftermarket case that doesn't fit well. Also, you only get one tip each for both the flosser and the toothbrush and there is nowhere to easily store extras. This kit is probably designed for single people only, not couples or families.",4
"Horrible! I saw them, and immediately threw them away. They are absolutely useless.",1
Works well and removes wrinkles...could be a better consistency but aside from that it's a cheaper version of most skin tighteners.,4
Came broken.  Not resolved by Seller,1
Scent vanishes after 5 min,1
"This is cute for little girls party! I am giving her a dance party this year, and I was looking for something to give the girls to dress us a bit, something fun and colorful to match the theme, these are perfect..<br /><br />The colors are nice, the bow is a great addition, basically I am very happy and will purchase again in future parties.<br />I will also add pictures after the party showing it on the girls (if i dont forget of course)",5
"Let me start by saying, you do have to apply at least twice a day for quick results, but it does work on my super cracked winter hands and my daughter cheek eczema, yesterday her cheeks were super red, applied at night and she walk up with no eczema.<br />It does leave things oily but that was expected, my husband however doesn't like that.<br />I will definitely but again and again.",5
It’s a good product. Love the large bottle and the brush handle.,3
"Ew no way. Okay so maybe not absolutely the worst mascara I have worked with. The applicator this product comes with is TERRIBLE. I like this companies products especially their mascara with the green top and tan cylindrical tube.<br /><br />For this product I am writing a review on. The mascara is gummy, does not spread well and takes a long time to dry. The applicator it comes with is absolutely the worst design I have seen. one positive thing about it is that it is very black. Which I do like.<br /><br />This product definitely does not work for me, nor would I suggest anyone to use it.",2
"Ok this bottle is no way the same bottle that is advertised...this is in a total different language😐 and the scent is way off from cucumber, even the soap bars are not the same scent. The spray is not so bad but I would not purchase again.",2
"This smells so good! It leaves your hair feeling clean, shiny and smooth. I have dry hair and after one wash with this shampoo, I noticed a huge difference. I got this with a discount.",5
Easy to apply and natural looking.,5
Makes a lovely gift -- who wouldn't want this?!,5
Horrible! Returned!,1
"I paid $24.99 for the 4 cavity 3 way lipstick mold and a few days later it jumped to $59, possibly different sellers I don't know, but it was good timing on my part.<br />Considering I have read we might consume more than 2 pounds of unhealthy lipsticks per lifetime it might have been worth the higher $59 price to be able to use any recipe for lipstick or chapstick I want, when I want it, not to mention any color in the world.<br />After finding and deciding to purchase this mold a few days later I purchased lipstck tubes, tiny measuring spoons and spatulas, the best butters from across the world (thank you Amazon), oxides and pigments from Amazon.<br />Because the orders arrived so quickly and wrapped so securely, it didn't give me much time to research lipstick and color recipes to tweak and make my own, so I haven't yet opened my new mold. I continued to search and learn about high gloss, matt's, waterproof and plumping, supple and antiaging recipes and I am now ready to give this a try.<br />It all looks pretty basic, even cleaning the mold.<br />Right now I have my favorite (not necessarily healthy) Chapstick in every room, all vehicles, and in my purse for constant dry, hot, freezing, desert weather protection and I can't wait to replace them with my own tints, and colored lipsticks.",5
"This compact travel brush is exactly what I was looking for. In addition to a retractable brush, it contains a small mirror. Its pink color is bright and clear, and the round design of the case is cute.<br /><br />This tiny brush fits neatly into a pocket or purse. Its hinge is a bit tight when unfolding it, but the brush itself has good quality bristles. They are plastic with rubber tips and are firm enough to effectively move through my thick, short hair.<br /><br />All in all, I am quite satisfied with this purchase.",5
Muy buena calidad,4
This product is crap I just bought a new 48 watt led light and 120 seconds still isn't cured.. now let's talk about product size it's tiny samples idk if you could get 1 set out of one color my slip solution was empty and yes it is easy to use the pictures of the product is not the size you get,1
"Love this product ! Leaves my skin soft,  and fresh fragrance ! Great on my dry skin ! Would recommend.",5
Gave this to my uncle and he loved it!!,5
These are handy to help with oral care.  Great buy for a great price.,5
Easy,5
Smells nice. Works great,5
"Sheds and Rough. It's really 1A hair. More like -1A Hair. The closure is hella rough. I'm pretty sure it's not real human hair because my hairdresser said that when she tried to highlight it the colors wouldn't take. I'm very disappointed. The closure shed so much to the point where there is a bald spot. I will be contacting them about their product and if they don't answer, I will contact amazon",1
Like many here have said before - the product I received was past expiration date,1
"I love this!  Smells great, and not too overpowering at all!",5
Excellent color for those of us with light blonde hair.  The slight golden shimmer is enchanting. Stays on my eyebrows 6-8 hours.  I appreciate cruelty-free products. I will definitely purchase again.,5
"I can't believe how great these matched with my own hair! They clip in nicely, stay put, and can be styled easy. I love them so much and am thrilled with them! There's enough hair in the box that both my sister and I can both wear them. Buy them, you will love them!",5
Smells great and works great on skin. Used some to make chapstick and it really made a difference. Would buy again.,5
"This gel burned my face within a minute. I don’t have sensitive skin and I have used all different types of products including peels. This burn is SO HOT, it will likely take a while to heal.<br /><br />I would say shame on me for not patch testing but I’ve never had to with anything. Learned a lesson today.",1
Needed some hair bands for my short hair style and purchased these headbands. They stay in place and tend to not bother me as much as some other headbands.,5
"I've only had this product for a little while, so I can't attest to any long term efects. But from my experience, I am so pleased with the way this mask has made my skin feel.  It's made my skin incredibly soft and even felt a little &#34;plumped&#34;.  The old saying about 'soft as a baby's bottom&#34; was the first thing I thought of that could describe it.  It's easy to use, makes my face feel wonderful and easy to integrate into my skin care routine. I recommend this product because it makes my skin feel &#34;dewy&#34; and truely pampered!  5  Stars!!",5
Beautiful it clipped and pinned to my hat perfectly .,5
"These smell really nice, are well foaming and silky smooth. Love them.",5
"I'm only giving 4 stars because although these ties are true to their name - they really do not crease your hair - unless you wrap them around your ponytail three times, they slip down. So you are faced with the choice of having a comfortably loose ponytail (2 wraps) or a tight but secure one (3 wraps). I still use them but don't recommend them for golf or any athletic activity.",4
Lasted only Two months,2
"I hate typical air fresheners that smell so fake and have who-knows-what kind of crap in them. We use this in the room that has our cats' litter boxes in it, and spritz a couple times after scooping. It takes care of the smell right away, and lasts a long time!",5
Bristles fall out into mouth first few uses. Once that is over they’re fine.,3
perfect,5
I absolutely love these headbands. Finally something that stays on my round head with baby fine hair. I use them every night will applying my skin care system.<br />They are beautiful and very well made,5
"Really nice barrette!  It's a bit of a tight squeeze for shoulder length, medium thick hair but once I figured it out, it fits perfectly.  I'm thinking of buying the other color now.",5
Leaves your hair silky smooth!,5
Gave this as a gift and my friend loved it!  Especially getting two!!  Would buy again :),5
"Good color and coverage. Sharpens perfectly. Good match for paler blondes. I've used Rimmel hazel in the past, this is better. More of a true ash blonde and not as dark.<br />However, to save money, buy it from the Essence company online. They cost $1.99 each and if you order $15 of product delivery is free. Fast shipping too",5
"Was completely unusable, smashed and leaking.",1
Love the sheer color and the softness - would definitely order again,5
Super comfy and bigger than I was expecting. Easy assembly- looks good.,5
"Finally, something that you leave in your hair that works. I have silver hair, but use a  gradual color darkening product which overtime, can dry my hair out a bit. This leave in conditioner really makes my hair soft, shiny and smells wonderful (not perfumey).  The next day, it looks even better!",5
"I'm one of the unfortunate ones who actually had to pay for these. Most of the reviews (close to practically all) were from people who received a complementary set, in exchange for their honest opinion.  I'm not sure if I'm using the same product as all the rest of those 5 star reviewers, but these do absolutely zero/zilch. OK, the rose water or whatever they're packed in smells nice, and they feel OK on your eyes, but so does a cheap ice mask, which gives better temporary results...not to mention, positioning these super thin, slimy gizmos is a pain in the butt.  Eventually, you'll get them to stick and assume all that work will pay off.  I have bags under my eyes, and after using these five times (every other day) there's not even a 0.1% difference. I even tried them first thing in the morning when my eyes were at their worst.  This is the placebo effect at its best!",1
holy crap this stuff is so pigmented be careful pumping it out you do NOT need a lot and do NOT use your hand to pump on as it will stain your skin. get a styrofoam plate or use a counter then windex or bleach after. very very pigmented very beautiful.,5
I was using rose water witchhazel for many years. Then I got this to try out. One is to cleanse. This one is to definitely lock in moisture with healing properties. This is wonderful to use at anytime. My favorite is after splashing my face with water to help lock in natural elements. I recommend for anyone with sensitive skin and/ or aging skin.,5
But only if you use multipile layers.,3
"Absolutely amazing product. I have sensitive skin and I was a little worried to try, but this product is great I had no issues and coverage is great!",5
I love it !!!,5
Very nice for the price.  Love the holder,5
"I have medium thick hair and these work well. I particularly love the red (which are hard to find) and the teal color. Pale pink is an interesting color also. These are normal, good quality.🦋",5
Perfect for what I need them for.,5
Feels stronger than ItWorks wraps and is WAY cheaper. First wrap is on now so we will see! Feels like it's working!,5
Perfect,5
Buen producto .precio accesible .la calidad del producto es buena y efectiva,5
Loved the color. A lot got tangled but I still hand enough to do my whole head so I’m happy.,5
Waste of time the lashes do not stick I tried many times all that happened is that  the black glue gets on your eye and fingers,1
Poor quality<br />They are 2nd's.,1
Big sunflower clip; stays put in my hair. Looks good with red hair.,5
"At first I was kind of nervous in buying/using this because I had never used a self-tanner, and this one is known to last longer and not be orange. On first application, I noticed a wonderful difference in my skin tone. From winter white to a lovely golden tone. Not orange.<br />I followed the instructions, though, and I think that's the main thing. Exfoliate really well and there should not be orange problems, and it should last a week or so.",5
"Hard to straighten the roots and takes too many passes for it to actually be straight. I have curly, thick, coarse hair, so it doesn’t work that well, even on high heat.",3
They do what they're supposed to do.,5
"These files are fantastic. I really like the fact that they're not etched like any other glass file. They do a great job at filing natural nails without all that ear splitting, teeth hurting, grinding noise other glass files make.<br /><br />As far as buffing/polishing goes, yes, they do make a naked, natural nail shiny.  But unless your nail is free of bumps, humps, divots, etc., it's going to take a long time to shine the nail evenly. What you end up doing is making thin/weak spots in the nail which will cause breaks or cracks as the nail grows out because these files take off a lot of nail. You can get shinier nails quicker with a base coat.",4
"The bristles are super soft, almost like a make-up brush soft. Too soft to clean anything. They were a light gray and got lighter after first use. 6 bristles fell out during first use. I doubt these have any charcoal compared to the deep, black coloring of other brushes.<br /><br />The toothpaste is an unknown brand from China. I'll try many things, but I ain't trying that.",2
"The description says shaving brush and that's why I bought it. But the brush box says its a Beard Brush. So, I still tried using it as a shaving brush. Big mistake. It was like using a pot & pan scrub brush. I couldn't raise up a lather it's so stiff. But it did a nice job exfoliating my face.<br /><br />Badger? Don't think so. I have many real badger brushes. This appears to be horse or boar. There might be some goat mixed in, who knows for sure?",3
"If you have multiple kids or travel a lot, these covers are excellent. Well made and very cute. I personally like the dog.<br /><br />Easy to clean and well made.",5
"It's gentle and cleanses well but I notice that it left a thin slippery residue that cannot be washed off easily. If you have a Clarisonic though it could help get rid of this problem. If not, maybe use a washcloth after rinsing.",4
"""Jeff's Wife"" - I've used the white name brand for years and some store brands but not the charcoal ones. These work just as good as the others, although I'm not sure if the charcoal really makes a difference.<br /><br />The description photos show slits in the strip but I haven't seen them in mine, not a big deal but they do serve a purpose. There is quite a bit of black residue left over (there's also residue left over when using the white ones, the black is just more visible) but it rinses away easily with warm water.<br /><br />I'm very happy with these.",4
"&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34; - I got these when they were an Add-On Item for $3.99, definitely worth the price. The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different. The edges aren't finished, like a plate with no backing, but I don't think it would cause anyone to slice their finger open unless you're being extremely careless.<br /><br />All in all a great set.",4
"&quot;Jeff's Wife&quot; - This is not true to color, it dries quite a bit darker, as you can see from the pic, but since I only use it for nail art I don't care but some of you might. I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.",5
"&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34;- These are so good! I only wish I had the original versions to compare. I've only heard negative things about the original stamping polishes from BM so I don't own any, I've only used MdU. But when BM reformulated their stamping polishes I gave them a try and I now own all the new collections so I gave these a try too. Boy am I glad I did. These DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish. The black I use is MdU, the absolute holy grail of stamping polishes. But I have to say that these are beyond good! This black is comparable to MdU black in every way, except the smell. These have just become my favorite! I don't think I will be ordering from anyone else anymore.",5
"Well built and compact. The charger base works well.<br /><br />So far the 'waterproofness' has endured splashes, but don't dare try to dump it in a tub of water.<br /><br />The brushes work well and are replaceable. They should be available on Amazon.<br /><br />The case is a cool and shiny white patent leather.",5
"&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34;-  Great plates and images that stamp beautifully, as always from Cici & Sisi. I do have two issues. One is that four of the six sleeves are cracked in the corners, like it's old, dried out plastic but I guess it's nothing that some packing tape can't fix. I've never had this issue with the other five sets from them. The other issue is the holder feels a bit more foam like instead of the pleather like the previous ones. But those issues have absolutely nothing to do the stamping ability of the images which, in the end, is the most important thing!",5
"This is my first time using plain silk wrap and I love it!  I started using the self adhesive silk tabs to fix cracks and they worked great so I wrapped all my nails but I had to keep buying them. So I upgraded to this. I'm so glad I did. Yes it takes longer to do my nails now but it's so totally worth it. I wrap my nails every week or so and there's still so much of it left! I will not buy anything else, EVER!",5
"Ideas are limitless with the buffet sections on the three plates. Like the other sets it's difficult to get a clean scrape on some of the corner images. But I do think it helps if you have a very flexible scraper, which I don't.",4
"If you like bay rum, then you'll like Florida Water. If you don't like bay rum after a hot shave then something is wrong with you. Turn in your man card immediately.",5
It was hard to wear and didn’t stay tight in my head so I returned it.,3
"I didn't see any reviews for these headbands and took a chance. I absolutely LOVE each and every pattern that is in this set. Nothing too crazy, but just enough to add a little extra to an outfit. Would highly recommend these.",5
Cleaning plaque & flossing.,4
"What a complete waste of money! I was pretty disappointed with this product. It absolutely did nothing for my lashes in terms of lengthening or thickening. I thought I would see some improvement but nothing changed in my lashes at all. That being said, it does seem to condition them pretty well, but not worth the money in my opinion.",1
I love this! I have Rosacea and the grape seed extract helps broken capillaries in your face which is great! I wash my face in the morning and apply a little bit to my face which helps my foundation go on really smooth!,5
"I discovered this brand through my ipsy bag, and was excited to try a few more best sellers from this brand. I personally love the vitamin c serum and the moisture boost cream. The squalene oil is great to mix with foundations that are a bit too drying without disturbing the coverage level or texture. Overall, great set.",4
"This is more of an oil than a serum in my opinion. It does absorb immediately and does not smell strong like many vitamin C serums. It smells very light and fresh with the slightest citrus scent to it. Great to use for both day and night. Does not contain a sunscreen, so make sure to use one during the day. Overall, highly recommended.",4
"I have very sensitive dry skin, So I was worried that this would over dry and irritate my skin. First of all, it smells amazing. It smells very natural, like greenery and botanicals. This mask has ever so slightly some grit to it. It isn't the scrubbiest of exfoliating masks. The clay doesn't over dry your skin. I do not feel like my skin is tight feeling after washing my face. Overall, it feels very luxurious and relaxing. Great weekly skin treat to unwind at home. Highly recommended.",4
"I have used the Farmacy cleansing balm for 3 years and this is the first time I have used another brand. I find this balm very hydrating. It removes waterproof makeup very well, has a very fresh scent and with a bit of water turns into a milky cleanser. It also comes with a scoop for sanitary use. Overall, it is a great cleansing balm at a reasonable price. Highly recommended.",4
"This is great for minimalists or teenagers. Keeps your essentials organized. you can keep makeup brushes and a few cosmetics in it. It also keeps jewelry, hair ties and other small items organized and easy to find. The mirror is removable as well. Very nice size, and can easily be wiped clean when needed. made of a thick plastic, and the holder slots are silicone. The mirror is a glass mirror. Overall, highly recommended.",4
"These are very good nail files. They work very well, and lasts through multiple uses. I have natural nails, and I I find that the two different grits work well with smoothing edges and removing sharp corners of nails after trimming. I was replacing my old files after every use and the sand was flaking off and getting all over my floors. I did not have any problems with these doing that. Overall, it's a very high quality product and I would highly recommend it, especially for professional use.",4
"I use this at night time as a serum before moisturizer. It smells wonderfully first if all. The texture is very thin and lightweight. It sinks into skin quickly. I do recommend wearing sunscreen during the day time as it can make your newer skin photosensitive. Overall, it's a very easy way to apply vitamin C to brighten skin and even skin tone.",4
"These are perfect for on the go and travel. Don't leak and the pads are nicely saturated. Great to keep in makeup bags or even as a stocking stuffer. I don't use perfume everyday, so these last me a while. Nice way to try out a fragrance before committing to a full sized bottle as well. Highly recommended.",4
"This makes hair styling very easy. Looks professional, and comfortable for all day wear. The band itself is kinda fragile so you have to be careful not to bend it too far apart or it might snap. Overall, it's a good product.",4
"I use this to fill with rubbing alcohol to use as hand sanitizer. I clip it to my bag and use the sprayer to disinfect shopping carts as well. Super handy. They sprayer works very well and does not get clogged. Overall, highly recommended. Have filled all of them and given them to family members to utilize as well.",5
"These are real Korean face masks from a great brand. I first discovered this brand from a subscription box and am now hooked. The box contains 10 masks and each are individually wrapped. They have a generous amount of serum in each. Great as a weekend treat at home after a bath. Overall, highly recommended!",4
"This set of scrunchies and sunglasses for a bride and her bridesmaids is silly but fun. The scrunchies are made of a nice satin type fabric. The sunglasses don't actually offer much sun protection, but they are cute.",4
"Overall, I like this powder and feel it is a good product. I have pale skin that can look sallow at times.  I like the pink tone to the shade that I got. The powder is easy to apply with the small puff included, but I prefer to use a soft applicator brush. This powder does have a bit of sparkle in it, which I don't always want, but it adds a nice glow for nighttime use.",4
"I wasn't really sure what dermaplaning involved before I ordered this product. I watched a couple of youtube clips and decided to give it a try. These tools are bladed scrapers that are used to gently scrape away dead skin and tiny hairs to give your face a fresh, clean, healthy look. In the videos I watched, there was a considerable amount of icky skin removed- literally piles of it! My experience has been much less dramatic. A whole face application resulted in just a tiny amount of ""dust"" to be removed. I applied a bit too much pressure at first and gave myself a little scratch, so do be cautious. These blades are sharp!<br />I feel that my skin does look brighter and more healthy. Those videos of dermaplaning likely feature models who had been tanning and not washing their faces so the dirt and oil really built up, and skin was ready to peel.<br />This product removes tiny ""peach fuzz"" hairs but I also tried it on a small patch of coarser leg hair that I had missed while shaving. It took it off neatly with no irritation.",4
Takes me back to childhood. I basically used this in lieu of a vapor rub. It really clears the sinuses. And the tingle feels great on achy spots.,4
"This stuff smells like hand sanitizer. It smells like straight rubbing alcohol and has a strange texture where it balls up when you rub it in. When I got to apply it to my sons face he yells that it hurts his eyes, and I tried it too and it's like rubbing alcohol is just evaporating into your eyes. If you do get this use it on arms and legs, then get a separate one for faces. That's kind of a hassle though so I'd just nix it all together and get a kid one that doesn't burn their eyes.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that it doesn't go on blue and fade. There's really no way to see where it's applied unless it does that weird crumbly thing, in which case I'm not sure if it's spreading onto the skin or just clumping up.",1
"I have short, stubby lashes so I was excited to try this. I ended up being pretty disappointed. At first, I thought the mascara was dried out because it looked like there was nothing on the brush. I have dark lashes so I couldn't see anything go on color-wise. I rubbed my hand on the brush and there was mascara on there, it just really did not thicken or lengthen at all. The bristles are also molded plastic, so they are scratchy and do not work well at distributing product. It's one of the worst designed mascara brushes I've seen. I thought it was old and dried up that's how bad it was. I will not be using or purchasing this mascara again.",2
"Prairie Rose Organics Mint Cocoa Velvet Body Cream is just that - thick, rich & creamy. Seeps into my skin to create a moisture barrier and the scent is heavenly! This has a very “true,” pure blend of cocoa and peppermint. This will make a beautiful gift!",5
"I've already used them all and they work well and feel good on my skin! The set comes with four pieces and a handle. The tools are all made of natural materials: shower bath brush, body massager, dry brush/pumice stone & loofah. The natural boar bristles bath brush is terrific - I can reach everywhere and it feels great on my back. I really jammed the handle on tightly and it didn't come off the brush while I was using it in the shower. Yet, I was able to remove it when I wanted to attach the massager. These can be used with just the attached handle strap, too. The loofah and pumice stone work great on my feet. Good quality, and I love the way they are packaged to make a nice gift box!",5
"My husband and I have both used these. I like the hydration, the hydroxy acid and the feel of these -- I do not find them too abrasive at all. I find them to have a very mild exfoliation and very mild peeling effect. My husband says that his skin tingles after shaving because they have alcohol (this has very little alcohol because it is listed way at the end of a long list of ingredients). So, I like them much more than he does! These pads are embossed with charcoal powder that draws impurities out of the skin and clarify the pores. My skin feels extremely soothed and hydrated after using these!",5
"My favorite soap!<br /><br />This smells heavenly! I'll get a whiff of sage while reading in my bedroom, even though the bars of soap are in a nearby bathroom. And it is DELIGHTFUL -- like the great outdoors! Invigorating.<br /><br />I'm using this in the shower as a body scrubber -- it's abrasive, with bits of sage in the soap.<br /><br />It may seem a bit pricey, but these are large bars of soap.<br /><br />Love, love, LOVE Pre' De Provence!",5
"I LOVE how this product did give me a beautiful natural glow however, the cost of that flow caused my skin personally to break out. The same ingredients in the moisturizer and this spot corrector is what causes me to break out. So unfortunately this was returned.",1
I love this eye glitter but these were all dried up and old! They couldn't be used.,1
These are great!!! They have enough stretch to be useable but still tight enough to hold your hair and return to their shape. The colors are so beautiful! They really do leave no lines in your hair!!,5
"Gel was very hard to work with and the fiberglass sheets were so thick they wouldn’t stay in a curve, they flattened out while curing the gel. Also any gel on the nail side of the fiberglass sheet would not cure right. I don’t know if this was because of the thickness of the sheets or what. Bought these to mend a small split over the quick on my nail plate (instead of using acrylic like I usually do) to keep it together until it grew out and it did not work. Won’t be using these again.",2
Love! I have terribly short lashes and this definitely built them up more than my typical layering of 3 mascaras.,5
"My skin is really sensitive.<br /><br />I also don't generally like all-in-one products. You should see my bathroom cabinets. Trying to consolidate, but I get different rashes in different places, and no one thing works for everything.<br /><br />This is very gentle and did not make my skin or face or scalp break out or rash up at all. It's not super moisturizing, but it wasn't drying, either. The scent is very light, and the cleanser has a little minty/tingly kick. This would have worked for me in my teens or 20s when I couldn't wait to get out of the shower and on with my life.",4
"This is a good moisturizer and plumper for people whose skin is just starting to age. The plumpers are conventional ingredients, but nothing of major concern unless you are allergic.<br /><br />I did not get lasting results, but my skin is past just starting to age. I wish I'd had something like this at 40.",4
"The NuDerma wand has done a lot for my aging skin. There are a few creams and sera I swear by -> modern science is pretty cool. It used to be that anything topical just sat on your skin doing nothing (except the one with the french name and gazillion dollar price tag - which, btw, you can get much cheaper in the blue german tin plus seaweed serum). Anyhoo - enter the era of home treatments. Thermal machines are great if you have the money, and for less (but still not cheap) you can get these wands that are practically miraculous.<br /><br />Used correctly and alongside good skincare practices, they can clear acne, minimize lines, and restore an awful lot of tone and some volume to aging skin. They don't work for everyone, but my skin is thin from prednisone use and it's aging, and the NuDerma wand has been great at firming and plumping over time.<br /><br />Mine came with the red wands, and I wanted to try the blue on my kid's pizza face. Did I mention that these things zap you?<br /><br />Yeah, that's important. They zap you. You want to get some numbing cream. Anyway, he's never going to let me do this again, but it's too bad because it cleared his skin beautifully. And fast. And no giant pores from popping stuff. And because they are combination wands, I can use them on my skin.<br /><br />All for a very affordable amount.",5
"Among retinol creams can be a chore. The stuff is what it is, and retinol is good stuff, if you want to turn over your skin cells the way they used to do it for yourself.<br /><br />This cream has an excellent formula of retinol, moisturizers, and antioxidants. What it also has that many others don't is a pump that keeps air and light from destroying the ingredients. It's 3% retinol, which is pretty strong, so patch test.<br /><br />Recommend.",4
"These picks use plastic, but very little compared to other floss picks. The floss itself is also very fine, which makes it great for my tight teeth. East to carry. Easy to use. Wish it had no plastic, but that's why I save these for the road, and just use a water flosser at home.",5
"I'm bummed, because this seems to be working (eyelashes are way softer and less brittle), but it gave me a rash on my eyelids. I have lupus, and my skin is really sensitive, so this probably won't happen to you.",2
"This one is easy to use and results are great! I have it for a couple of months now. That is when I decided to do my own nails with gel. My sister-in-law recommended this machine because it was similar to the one that she has. It is not used much because I do my nails every 4-3 weeks. Original drills are good for some applications, but I got a set of diamond drills for Russian manicure. Since then, I never had gel peeling off from the bottom (which was a common problem when I did my nails at the salon) because I clean my cuticles with this machine. I remove old gel with this machine as well. I am a very satisfied customer.",5
Really liked it and it is didn't lose any stones so far.,5
I have a lot of facial rollers. The Y shape is my favorite. The gentle suction massage is very relaxing. This one has a nice weight and feels well made. It rolls smoothly and silently. It came in a velvet pouch in a sealed bubble bag. It's competitively priced right now at $13.99 plus an extra 40% off.,4
"I didn't care much for this sleeping mask. It came in an unsealed box. There's a plastic cover under the lid, but there was a mess of cream all around the rim and threads. Maybe it was used? It smells like lotion and salad dressing. It feels like Vaseline on the skin, which is okay for a sleeping mask. It made me feel like it was  certainly locking in moisture, but the next day, I didn't really notice anything different in my skin. I like sleeping masks but don't expect I would order this again. I definitely find it overpriced ($44) for the packaging, experience, and results - or lack thereof.",2
"This came with a foil seal in a bag. It's a very sweet scented gel that feels nice on the skin - like a soft layer/barrier, but unlike other overnight masks I've tried, the effects weren't really apparent once you remove this the next morning. It's currently $12.99.",4
"I used this later in a day, after derma rollering, and I felt it helped soothe my skin. No lingering irritation or redness from the derma roller. I'm not sure if it was this serum alone or how it worked in conjunction with my other skin care products, but my skin felt velvety soft afterwards. I enjoyed the lavender-scented milky texture of this serum. It came in a sealed box. It's affordably priced at $9.99. I would get this again.",5
"I really like Everyday Beauty's Hydrating Instant Mask so was hopeful for this Night Cream, but I wasn't as impressed. It didn't seem to leave my skin quite as velvety soft or last as many hours, yet the Night Cream is more expensive at $38/1 fl oz. The Mask is $22/1.7 fl oz and can be used overnight as often as needed. I use it as the last step in my skincare routine. This cream came in a box, unsealed and simply smells like a cream.",3
"If you love strawberries and/or are seeking a gentle scrub, this is a good choice. The sealed tub also had a plastic cover under the the lid and was boxed. The scrub had a little brown in it like what you might see when fruit starts to rot or in yogurt, but it's dated good until 9/14/2023, so I felt okay using it. The red particles made my husband and I realize we didn't confidently know the color of strawberry seeds, but I think they are. They feel kind of squishy, and the scrub feels more like a creamy moisturizing lotion. It does smell like strawberries and makes skin soft. This is a different scrub that feels gentle. I personally prefer one that feels like it's polishing and cleaning more than moisturizing though. This is currently $12.",4
"The bottle came in a sealed box. It's a light pink gel. The scent is nice but more fruity-rose like you might find in products scented for children. It cleans okay. I don't feel it's worth $16, but I don't think I would buy this one again regardless.",4
"The tube had a foil seal. There is a pineapple scent. You're supposed to massage the gel on dry skin for 2 minutes. As soon as you start, it starts to pill. I feel like most of it immediately dries up and falls off though I'm sure it's grabbing dead skin too. While it's gentle in that it's not using coarse particles, I didn't enjoy the dry rubbing and tugging at my skin. You can only avoid that over 2 minutes by applying a generous amount of gel, but it's a small tube. My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc). This is $12.99, which doesn't seem like as great of a value after seeing how much you need to use. I didn't like the application, results, or price enough to reorder this.",3
"I have a lot of orange-gold lip colors because I find them very flattering on me, so I was pretty confident I would like this. The color is beautiful and not too orange. While I like the gold too, the specks of glitter are larger and more obvious than I would like. Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips. With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again. I think I like the case the best, but I'm not convinced the color or feel add up to make it worth $38.",4
"I've used a drugstore pressed powder for years and always gotten compliments, so it's hard to think I need to pay $52. I can't say I was especially impressed by this. HOWEVER, I'm getting to the age where I'm starting to notice my makeup can look dry and accentuate lines I didn't even think I had. I'm not wearing much makeup these days, but based on reviews, I got this with the hope it will work for maturing skin. I can see this also washing you out a bit as another reviewer mentioned. It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt this needed a very light application. The good news is if such a thin dusting can live up to the reviews, it makes the price a little better. I was surprised how low quality the puff felt. It's very thin and almost felt rough.",3
"Reviews when I ordered this were raving about it. It's not bad, but it's not all that. Many more reviews have been added since then that reflect that.",3
"I needed a brush for my cats because the one I've been using removes almost too much hair and hurts my one cat plus it's uncomfortable to hold. The brushes I've been seeing look flimsy and painful with their wire tips. I liked the rubber tips on this so took the chance. It's working great so far. I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.",5
"I bought this out of curiosity about foam cleansers and because a reviewer said it smells like coconut. Actually, it smells like citrus pine to me, which makes a lot more sense looking at the pinecones on the package and the fact is says there pine leaf, grapefruit, and citron extracts. It's a nice scent if you like those. Anyway, I'm finding one pump of these foams work for me (maybe I would need more if I was wearing makeup, and I wish I could tell you how well this removes makeup). This spread thicker than other foams I have used so far. It felt like it did a good job cleaning and left my skin soft and fresh. The price is on par with other foam cleansers I've tried. This would last me a long time since I only need one pump, but I'm just as happy with cheaper cleansers with scents I prefer.",4
It did not do what it said it would,1
My daughter and I tried the lashes out as soon as we got them.  We wore them when we went out and they were beautiful and natural looking lashes.  We love these and I would definitely buy them again.  They came with a nice eyelash tweezer too!,5
"I gave it four stars, just because the flavor is so strong.  Apparently I lean toward blandness, because others I've talked to like it as is.<br />I won't toss it out.  I just rinse more after using it.",4
This works so good on face and hands and other dry skin areas. It's easy to use and feels so good. It really hydrates your skin. I use it every week. I will be buying more as gifts for my daughters birthdays.,5
"I loved that it came with an assortment of attachments.  There are three settings on the hair dryer; fan, low, and high.  Also it has a cool button.  Using it on low there was more than enough heat to dry my long hair in a short time.  The big attraction is that this takes up very little space in my tiny bathroom.",5
"I bought this to blend my own tea, and I was very impressed with how fresh this was when I opened the package.  I don't know how long this will hold it's freshness.  That will be the determining factor as to whether or not I buy a bag this large again.",5
"GOOD PRODUCT, EASY TO USE!",5
Great colors and nice metallic shine!  Will rebuy.,5
Love this product and the price much better than Mugler site!,5
"I was searching for something with Volufiline and found this inexpensive  tube.  Thought I would take a chance with it being much less expensive than others I found. It was delivered  on time and packaged really professional  and nice. I couldn’t wait to dab some on my eye areas. I went back to the mirror about  30 minutes later and almost every bit of puffiness  was gone. So, I dabbed a little more around the area and much to my surprise, my eye area looked like I just had botox!  I have used it going on almost 2 days and have already ordered more of their products.  Going to see how the Gold Milk Steam Cream 200g does on my mature skin along with the Pancoat Pop Vita gloss+lipstick+tint works out.<br />These are Asian companies and made.. Just as the Manufacturer  describes  - ""Cheap and works” . It has a nice soft aroma that goes away quickly as it is put on the skin.<br />I am shocked that there are not any other reviews for this product...<br />For the price and quality, so far I am super pleased and would recommend this product to others.",5
"My skin has always been, at best, blotchy, and if I try some kind of coverup, i usually break out.  I'm not sure what led me to this, but I picked this brand because it didn't seem to have any ingredients in it that I needed a chemistry degree to evaluate. Good choice. No, great choice. I have been using it for three or four days, and my skin is obviously clearer, almost not blotchy at all!  This is amazing. (Would it work for you? Only one way to find out. Tty it.)",5
"Shiny hair is nice - I've used a vinegar rinse for years, didn't need it with this shampoo.  However, my scalp itched incessently, and my hair continued to thin.  I think if I kept on using it, I'd have become tonsured.  I have gone back to the recipes in Grow Hair Fast, have made my own shampoo, used it for two days - and no more itch, and increased confidence I won't go bald.",2
Gets the job done.,4
"I received a sample of this in my IPSY bag, fell in love, then began the hunt for the right shades. This is the best lip stain/ long wear lippie I've ever used. Great pigmentation, smoking the, feels like nothing when wearing, the only truly non-drying lip stain or extended wear lipstick I've ever used. It really does last all day. If going for full coverage make sure to give it a solid 5 minutes to set. The hardest part is finding just the right shade. I ended up scouring YouTube for swatches.  REALLY love and recommend.",5
"Honest, these bottles and jars are great. High quality. I love that a spatula was included for the jars. I wish it was one for each, but really, I love the attention to detail there. I have used these, just got back from a short trip, and they will be going with me to Spain in 2 weeks for holidays. They do what they say they will, easy fill, click dial for the label, squeeze every bit out, no leaks. The zip bag ripped on second use. That was no bother to me,I didn't need it. EXCELLENT seller communication!  After purchase, I received an email to see if I was pleased, wrote back that I was, except for the bag, and described. Seller thanked me for honest input and is looking for a new supplier of more sturdy bags. Kudos to this little shop, I hope they do very well in the big Amazon world. Great customer service. Beyond the quality product, I would go out of my way to do business with this seller again.",5
"My new love- Good bye pouf balls. This is amazing, really feels like it is exfoliating, especially now with my dry itchy winter skin. I love this. Kept one, will be giving the other two away with nice shower stuff as gifts, then will order more for myself. I wish I had of found these years ago.<br /><br />Adding to previous review- I am finally ordering another 3 pack. I gave away 2 of the first 3 pack as stocking stuffers to family. Now everyone in my family is talking about these and wanting them. *Please note, if you have really sensitive skin (like me) these work great, just remember don't scrub as hard as you would with your everyday pouf ball thing. These do the exfoliating job just great without lots of pressure. Also, mine has held up beautifully. I throw it in the wash and air dry, still looks new. I really love how I can use on back. I know it sounds silly to get this lathered up (hahahaha) over a product, but this is a game changer.",5
"This is a lovely smelling perfume smells just like Juicy!  It lasts a very long time just about as long as juicy does and it does not have  an over bearing scent like some perfumes it comes in a good sized bottle that will last me for quite a while! Very happy with this purchase will buy again and will also try other scents form Watermark Beauty!<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive this product at a discounted price during a special promotion to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />The discount has not influenced or impacted my judgement of this product. I take this seriously and include my own opinion and experience with each product I review. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. If you have found my product review to be helpful, please thumbs up this review. This will make it easier for others to find this review so they may be helped as well.",5
"I have one in each car, my handbag, by the front door for when I get the mail.  I give them as stocking stuffers.",5
"If you, or your child suffer from skin rashes like eczema, psoriasis, or just have dry skin, this is amazing.  My 15 month old grandson has had ongoing issues with eczema since birth and this is the only thing that has really worked.  We use is everyday and it's just amazing how fast the splotches start to fade away.  Love it!",5
"One was missing the cap. So I can't use that one for anything but my own use, I can't use it for customers.",4
"I have to admit that I don't use the bottles with the crystals although they do look nice. I wanted to try the facial roller. I had another facial roller that I liked but it disappeared so I wanted to see if this one was just as calming and cool.<br /><br />Good news is that the facial roller in the Rose Quartz Massager Facial Roller with Bottles for Essential Oils is cool and calming. I give it a slight edge over my old one because the rose quartz is pretty. I'm not sure if it is anti-aging because I don't really pay attention to that. If it is having an effect, then great, but for me, the rolling action helps me wind down at the end of the day. The motions are soothing and quartz is cool against the skin. It is easy to clean and it keeps well too. With the two roller bottles, it does make a nice gift set. But this is a set that I'm keeping. Hopefully this one doesn't disappear.",4
"I like this Makeup Sponge Beauty Makeup Sponge Blender Professional Foundation Sponge. It says ""Snowflakes"" on the plastic box but I don't know if that is the actual brand name. Given the teardrop design, it probably can be used with a powder based item like eye shadow, but I prefer to use it for foundation blending/application. I like how sponges can use a bit of water with the foundation to help with spreading the foundation on the skin and this sponge does a nice job of this. The foundation goes onto the skin so it looks sheer, fresh and polished. It also does a good job of blending so concealer conceals but doesn't appear obvious. I like that is easy to clean and doesn't have the ""make up sponge"" smell. If anything makes me stop using a make up sponge, it is the rubber-y used smell that it can get, but this sponge doesn't have that smell so I'm glad of that.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice makeup tool to have in the make up box. I like it.",4
"Small but works perfectly for mixing foundations and other cosmetics, and useful for travel. I like it!!",5
Not for me but my son's girlfriend LOVES this product.  The brush shape didn't work well with my fine lashes but she says it works well with hers. She loves both of these mascaras!!,5
"I have fine hair and I was concerned that the boar bristle would pull my hair or get entangled in it.  So far I'm loving this brush - one benefit over others is that the tips are coated which helps keep it from getting tangled.  It is a lightweight brush but seems to be very well made.  I've used brushes before (including boar bristles) and I like this one just fine.  I've only had it a couple of weeks so if anything changes, I'll add to this post.  So far, thought, it seems quality and gives me a perfect curl under on my ends!",5
"Had been using this perm for years when the store quit carrying it. Was glad to find it on Amazon. It is not a strong permanent solution so it rarely burns the hair.  I'm sure you could but it really is good for fine hair. It does have a strong perm solution smell that lasted through the first shampoo, but since it is so good with my hair, it is a small price to pay.  It is important to do a test curl if your hair is a bit longer in order to ensure the bottom curls as much as the top. I didn't time it right last time and the bottom of my hair didn't curl as tightly as the top. A test time would have helped. Still, overall it is an excellent perm for thin delicate hair.",5
"Smells great, feels good. There are no ingredients which are reactive on my sensitive skin. The measured dose and airless pump are super features. Best of all, my muscles are not &#34;twitchy&#34; when I lay down to sleep at night.",4
I'm a big fan of silk powder as it is so nice for my uber sensitive skin. Happy to have found this as its a great price for silk powder.,5
"This did absolutely nothing for my hair. If anything, it made the static worse. This was a disappointment.",1
"Very pretty comb, using as a bridesmaid accessory. It looks delicate and lovely.",5
"This product is great for mending broken and cracked nails, but it is a little difficult to cut the silk to the right size.",4
These are not the same size as your standard cotton swab. They have a smell also.  If you plan to use them out of the box think again. The box is so tight it is hard to get the swabs out and to open and closed the box. All of the boxes are in a larger box. We had to tear the larger box to get all the smaller boxes out.  No wear does it say the swab are organic. We will not be buying these again. We will use these for non-ear and body cleaning.  In our opinion it would be helpful to have a container to put these in. Not good for travel in our opinion as the box is flimsy and they are just so difficult to get out especially when the box is full.,1
"These replacement heads were a perfect fit for my rechargeable Oral B toothbrush. The bristles are firm, but not hard, so brushing is thorough but not painful. They're also more resilient than the original brush heads which got bent out shape very quickly. By comparison, these hold up quite well. And the price for all 8 heads is quite reasonable.  There's no reason why I'll ever buy any other replacement heads as long as I can get these.",5
"One of the trials of growing older is a fuzzy face, so I appreciate the gentle way this shaver attacks that fuzz, whether it's soft and peachy, or stiff where the hair has gone white. No nicks, no burn, no discomfort, just a light buzz, and the hair is gone. Sometimes it takes a couple of passes, but it gets the job done.  And I love the light that lets me see more clearly where the hair is or isn't.  Well worth the money in my opinion. Runs on a single AA battery.",5
"A little goes a long way with this foaming cleanser which is probably why you don't get a lot in the bottle.  It lathers up nicely, and comes off leaving a slight slickness on my skin like most moisturizing face or body washes.  My face felt good after I used it, clean but not tight or dry.<br /><br />It is awfully pricey for what you get, so I can't tell you to rush right out and get yourself a bottle. I couldn't afford to use it all the time.  I note that it comes with instructions on how to reuse the bottle, thereby cutting down on waste. Unfortunately it came wrapped in several layers of paper in a special box, so... Not quite as small a footprint as they're saying.<br /><br />Nice enough, but not a necessity.",4
"Yes, I do love this product.  Not so much for my face because it's probably the most emollient moisturizer I've ever used, and I don't like the feel of anything heavy on my face, particularly during the summer when the humidity is high.  But on the rest of my skin?  This feels like heaven.  As I've gotten older my skin has gone from mixed to quite dry, and this facial moisturizer just ends the flaking and itching, just stops it dead.<br /><br />I can't say if there's an anti-aging effect going on here since the only place my age shows on my skin is on my face, but if the way my skin feels after applying it is any indication, I'm getting younger by the day.  It's a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don't need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  So if you have dry skin anywhere on your body, I would say don't hesitate to try this stuff.  You may just be happier inside your skin than you have been in a long time.",5
"I have no idea what this stuff is or how it works, but it helps my mouth when it's irritated or when I have a sore in it. I had a canker sore (which I tend to get when I'm sick or stressed) and it healed it up before it grew larger as it usually does. I burnt my tongue on hot tea last week and swished this around my mouth mixed with water a few times, and my tongue was fine the next day. It doesn't heal you up right away, but it seems to make you heal faster. It burns and tingles too, so if you hate that feeling I'd avoid it.",5
These are becoming scarce. I searched everywhere. Most are flimsy. These are sturdy and attractive at a decent price. I bought oval ones. Get them!,5
Meh.,4
"They did  not work, came dry. 100 percent waste of money. It is as if somebody tried this item out returned it and than they sent it to me.",1
Wonderful and beautiful!,5
For some reason the one I received was WAY lighter than the one I already owned.<br />It still works but it definitely wasn't the color I expected.,4
"love argan oil for hair and face.  no greasy feeling, feels wonderful",4
feels nice on the skin.  no greasy feeling.  no smell.  nice moisturizer overall,4
Excellent product!  Been using it for 3 days and there is a noticeable difference. My beard is soft and the not itchy any more.  I really enjoy the sent smells like I just left the babrber shop.  I will definitely buy this again,5
"Hands down best hair dye ever, and I've tried a bunch of brands. It lasts the longest and has the most vibrant colors.<br />It smells like cherries and has the consistency of something like cold cream.<br />For best results I bleach my hair to at least a medium blonde, although it is best practice to bleach as light as you can go. Don't even try it with black hair, it won't show at all.<br />I wash my hair once a week and the vividness last at least a month if using sulfate-free shampoo and cold water. Thereafter the color starts to fade into a lighter and less saturated tone, but still pretty. Since my hair is damaged by the bleach, the dye stains my hair and it settles to it's final color in about 4 months.<br />The dye helps smooth out my hair considerably after a damaging bleaching session.<br />I only wish they had more colors and jared versions since getting it out of the bottle is a pain when you reach the bottom. This stuff also stains your furniture and bedding (dark colors moreso than others)<br />Attached are photos of my hair freshly dyed shocking blue, and after a few months.<br />Other pictures include the dyes atomic pink, blue velvet, and fishbowl freshly dyed and after a few months.",5
"I use these as replacements on my Shu Umura curler, it fits alright, not perfectly, with a small gap on both sides.",4
"I love the wide selection of soaps, so many to choose from. The soaps are long lasting but can make you a little dry, which is normal for bar soaps I think. It's a great deal and a good way to sample multiple scents. THe bar is a square about the size of my palm.",5
"Full disclosure, I ordered this for the mascara.  I'd ordered one of the gift sets previously, liked the products but the mascara gas become my go-to.  Not too thick, not too sticky, doesn't flake.  Oh yeah, the lip gloss is nice too, but a little thick for my taste.",5
"This is a very sturdy comb, I use it almost every day with no wear-and-tear to show for it.",5
good product/service,5
Works perfectly as intended with no issues!,5
"Wanted a nice comb as i kept losing the $3 ones from the stores. Much smoother and nicer to use, and quite durable so far(i spin it on the loop so it takes quite a few falls). Plus youll want to keep track of it unlike a normal comb",5
"I have used this conditioner 3 times now.  I live in a humid, tropical zone. It works very well - just as well as any other bottled conditioner.  All one has to do is modify and adjust the way one is ""accustomed"" to applying conditioner.  It will take some getting used to for me.  So far I used a combination of rubbing the bar over my head and running it over the long hair ends placed in my hand.  I am very pleased with it.  The citrus scent is nice, it isn't feminine or masculine, but crisp and light. I will buy it again.",5
Very greasy! Horrid taste!,1
"These are by far the best of these kind of towels I have ever had!<br /><br />I have super long hair, and these are long enough so the ends of my hair don't bunch up in the bottom or fall out.  The towels themselves are SUPER soft and maintain the softness even after washing.  The elastic & button are sewed on well, and hasn't stretched.<br /><br />I also found they are more absorbent than the other towels I have bought previously.  Highly recommend these!!!",5
"Didn't see boosting effects at all. It doesn't even spray, the liquid just dribbles out the sprayer and runs down the side of the bottle. Having a sprayer is completely useless",1
"Hoped product would improve my hair and it does somewhat, but seems a bit heavy on my hair.  Haven't done the 5 min treatment, only 2-3 minutes, when I'm showering, wash my hair, put this stuff in and then continue with my shower, which only takes a few minutes.  It does help hair comb out with no tangling, but can get that with any good conditioner.  I do need to address their sales/customer service actions - received email asking about the product, if I was happy with it, etc, and responded that I hadn't tried it yet, and after trying a few times would leave Amazon review.  In the next couple of weeks I received 3 more emails, which I found annoying.  So I'll say the product was okay, sales follow up was very annoying.",3
I purchased a 24inch bundle to add to a wig I ordered from a different company. The bundle arrived and was packaged very well. I co-washed it and added it to my wig. I love this hair! It blends very well with my wig too-No difference in quality- 5 stars! I would buy it again.,5
Seems to work great! Only thing is that the cap won't fit back on once it is taken off which makes the product dry out.,5
"I have never had something make my hair feel as awful as this does. It really feels like glue has been rubbed all through my hair. Awful. The ONLY thing this has going for it is that it smells nice. Otherwise, it's really very bad.",1
"I count Emergen-C among my top ten can't live without products.  I have at least one everyday.  Not only do they taste great (most of the flavors), they really do make me feel better, healthier and go a long way toward reducing headaches.<br /><br />The pink lemonade?  I was skeptical of it at first but it is REALLY good!  My top three favorite Emergen-C flavors are Cranberry, Raspberry and now Pink Lemonade.  All very tasty.<br /><br />Pink Lemonade will now be a regular part of my Emergen-C rotation.  Yum!",5
"I was surprised to see so many bad reviews. These were easy for me to install. I got a good, clean cut. After using old and dull blades, these were so much better. I wish it came with a cleaner brush, but after digging around in drawers in the bathroom, one was found.",5
I use it during daytime without any makeup. It makes my skin look much better and natural.,5
feels a little cheap in the hand but its nice that it folds and it work perfectly fine. my first UV light for nail and id reccomend it.,5
"These were very cheaply made, but I guess in this situation I got what I paid for.  They discolor very easy and did not cut well at all.  With that being said I need to state that I am use to utilizing professional shears and thinners.  These would probably be ok for home use with the occasional bang trim.",1
Much ado about an OK product.,3
"I think my skin is beyond redemption from working outside, desert gardening and working inside, housecleaning.  But it does feel nice on the skin and has a delightful fragrance.",4
I bought this pin for my wife.  The quality is terrible.  The pin fell off the button as soon as we took it out of the package.,2
"I bought this for my 86-year-old mother, she absolutely loves it!!!",5
"I love this bottle!  It is a gorgeous color and sleek feminine design!  Good job BHPC~ I grabbed this body mist because of the bottle and I instantly liked it.  Light musky, earthy scent.  Not floral at all, or clean or citrus.  If you like more oriental fragrances, as I do you'll like this.  Perfect for anytime.  It's a bit like the way more expensive Jean Paul Gaultier, which I have, wear and love!",4
This is a lovely nice scented light Creme. It reminds me of a French Creme I bought in Paris by Diadermine. The texture is perfect for any skin type. Don’t buy it if fragrance bothers you. I love nice smelling products. Love this rather obscure creme,5
Very nice but pads are a bit dried up which is weird!,4
"This pulls in digital signals perfectly, and the cut-out in the middle makes for some interesting window decoration.",5
Great product it smell pretty good and it hydrates the skin,5
Works fine e I wish it was a little bigger,5
"First off, you shouldn't be shaving anything but your face with this razor.  Norelco's older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn't cut grass more than 1/2"" high.  It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can't handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean.  It also won't do armpits or backs or legs very well.<br /><br />I'd go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor.  You'll need it to clearcut your axillary forest.",2
"I did not purchase this on Amazon, but purchased at a local store because I wanted to physically view it first.  I have a bathroom with a sink under a large window.  There is a small space between the sink and windowsill that is tiled in polished marble subway tile (with almost no grout lines).  This is my children's bathroom and I wanted to give them a mirror to help them with brushing their teeth.  I needed something small that did not require nailing or gluing and that would not break and hurt my children if it fell off.  This item pretty much perfectly fit the bill.  My one worry was that it would not actually stick to the slightly uneven marble tile surface.  I was also a little worried that the image would be warped and ultimately unhelpful.  I have had this now for about a year and it has held up beautifully.  It fits in the space perfectly, has a nice modern and clean look that blends into the slightly grey tone of my marble tile and most importantly, stuck without any problems (make sure to stick to clean DRY surface), even with small fingers poking at it.  NOTE that I cannot really comment on the other reviewers' comments about fogging.  It has never fogged up for us, but our placement doesn't really lend to anything fogging to begin with.",5
Cute,3
Spouse swears by this stuff.  Only issue was one of the bottles leaked in transport.  Didn't lose much out of the bottle. Decent deal,4
"It does what it says and my spouse refuses to use anything different. Trust me as a person who gets to hear about it first hand from a person who uses it daily,,, This has got to be good stuff",5
Best product I have ever used. My blackheads are visibly reduced and it makes my skin feel soft without being dry.,5
"If you are naturally light, don’t waste you money on this. It pulled out all my orange pigment and now I have to figure out how to fix the mess I got my self into. Unfortunately the lesson is don’t trust the reviewers too much because everybody’s hair is different. Just be cautious.",1
"This aftershave as of most Fine aftershaves is cooling and has face skin tightening properties.  The scent<br />is somewhat lacking,  very  faint in the lavender smell.  The lasting of the scent is a couple of hours or<br />so.  I do like the Fine aftershaves and have purchased several different scents.  However,  this lavender<br />is NOT what I was expecting in the scent aspect...",3
"These bottles are not your average travel bottles that you find in the .50 cents bin at Wal-Mart.  They are made to use. In<br />my opinion they are not expensive.  They are high quality and made very tough.  As the old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.<br />So,  if you are looking for a 4oz bottle for travel or use in the bathroom,  these are the ticket.  Worth every penny.<br />THEY DO NOT LEAK...",5
"This stuff is about as much a deodorant as an airplane with no wings.  Cakes up under your arms,  has a faint smell<br />somewhat like a flavoring extract.  The very faint smell sure isn't sandalwood.  I surely WOULD NOT recommend to<br />anybody.  Truth is truth,  Fact is fact.  You have been advised...",1
UPDATE: unfortunately this product doesn’t seem to last for very long after application... all my nails started popping off within a few hours ☹️<br /><br />Took a little bit of practice but this kit is great for the price 🙂,1
Not worth the money,1
"Nice looking nails. Easy instructions and easy to use.  Makes acrylic-like nails easy at home.  Unlike traditional nails, these wear very well, and don't chip or flake off<br /><br />In the attached photo I have my nail I've had for over a week, and though my nail is beginning to grow out, the color itself if still holding fast",5
I purchased these not for their intended purpose.  I use them as a display for all my polish colors.  I glue them to index cards and mark the brand and name/number of the polish so I know exactly which color I want to choose with no guesswork.  They work great for this purpose.,4
"The bottles are a nice size, with plenty of polish to work with!  2 thin coats is all I've need to get full coverage. These are a great variety of neon colors.  So fun to work with!  Great for using as a base for stamping.  If applied correctly as directed I have had the polish last for up to 2 weeks.  This is a great value and I highly recommend this polish.",4
This soap is great for gifts or yourself!  There are 2 bars nicely wrapped together.  Lavender and peppermint both smell great.  The peppermint has a nice cooling sensation.  They suds nicely and rinse clean with no residue.  Would highly recommend it!!!,5
These worked great the first three times I sprayed my plants.  Then they broke. Junk.,1
"I have a big fluffy beard. Unfortunately in the winter, it more resembles a brillo pad in texture and I sometimes look like a homeless person.<br /><br />This oil works well to condition and treat your beard, and the skin underneath. I apply it right out of the shower after towel drying my beard while it is still damp. I use three squirts of oil, placed in my palm, run my hands together and massage into my beard. It keeps my beard soft and supple all day, and treats the skin underneath to stop dryness and itching.<br /><br />I almost thought of trimming my magnificent beard down because it was so rough, and it was itchy, this is allowing me to continue to grow it.<br /><br />My beard hair is soft, manageable, and free of knots.<br /><br />The glass bottle is heavy duty, so you can take it when you travel.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the cost. It's pretty expensive, but I think a bottle would last you 2 months or so, but it's still a pretty hefty price to pay for a soft and manageable beard, free of itchiness.",5
"My wife is a professional hair stylist. She cuts my hair every 2-3 weeks and relies heavily on using electric shears to do so.  This unit works very well. It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.<br /><br />The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.<br /><br />Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.<br /><br />Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.<br /><br />The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn't really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears. This unit is actually as powerful or more powerful than most shears you buy at walmart or the like.<br /><br />Overall a great shear for home hair cutting.",4
"This is a great way to trim your beard. A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.<br /><br />The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.<br /><br />The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the ""Turbo"" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards. A must have!!",4
"This is a very good product for those of us who want to have fun with enhancing skimpy eyelashes.  There are some excellent mascaras available, but for pizzazz you can't beat false eyelashes.  The only problem, and this isn't a huge one, is that the strip that on which you apply the adhesive is very very thin and flexible.  This makes it hard to apply the adhesive evenly and to achieve a strong hold.  With practice this becomes less of a problem.  The scissors are nice, not spectacular and not very sharp; but a nice addition.  All in all a good buy and great for us makeup artists or rather those of us who would like to be.",4
While a little pricey this conditioner is worth every penny.  I have had to wear wigs for twenty years and always on the lookout for good products to keep my wigs looking good.  This is my absolute favorite to date.  Only thing that went wrong was that the product arrived having leaked into the packaging.  A messy gooey mess and the loss of product.  To keep your wigs looking good I strongly recommend this conditioner.  A plus is that it has a very pleasant scent.,5
"I wanted this to work with my hair style so badly!  I've always wanted to wear a crown for an event.  It was gorgeous and high quality.  I did end up returning it, but it was because of my hair, not the crown itself--it was perfect!",5
I’ve tried many similar sized bottles and caps on these are great. They seem sturdier.,5
"I used to buy this all the time in the stores, but it is hard to find lately. So glad I found it on Amazon!<br /><br />If you've never used it before, it is a very pretty nailpolish that appears to change colors in the sunlight. I recommend using a layer or two over any base color, because it does come on pretty light and adding a base coat can really change the full effect. There are many colors available to choose from, and this one changes from a light green-ish color to a purplish shade.<br /><br />Enjoy!",5
"I really wanted this product to work. I have used it as directly for over a month and unfortunately it did not get rid of my blackheads or reduced the size of my pores. It does leave the skin soft and clean which is why I kept it, but the blackheads remained. So far, the only thing that has helped me keep those annoying blackheads off my nose is extraction.",2
As advertised. Needed for hand sani to put on my uniform. No leaving or breakage. The zippy thing and carabiner were handy. Good price,5
I like that these don’t squeeze my head.  Soft velvet and plastic on underside with teeth. I bought set of black braided ones and also the jewel tone set.  Eventually the ribbons on the ends of the black ones came undone. They need to do something about that.<br /><br /> Please bring back the set of black velvet ones.,5
"OK now let me say these are very good for filing/nail shaping. As for buffering, if ur not careful, they'll buffer ur natural nail right off! Perhaps I missed it but I think these are meant for acrylic not natural nails. 2 sides are extremely coarse, on is better for buffering natural nails and the 4th side is for polishing after buffering. I'll have 2 continue my search.",3
"This is a real review from someone that had an eye issue from left sides paralysis.  This helped me so much.  It was comfortable to wear all day and I even wore it at night.  If you need to wear something to protect your eye, I highly recommend this product.",5
"Looks great. Purchased as gift, but wish it were for myself!!!",5
I love intense vibrant colors. Drab is dead.  It's too hot & humid here for eye shadow but great for eyeliner & fun colored mascara!,5
I guess red heads are too rich in natural color for these.  But my niece & my mother will enjoy.,3
Creativity,5
Damaged dry hair? This will bring it back to life!!!,5
Feet are super sticky.,4
At firstbi though the color was terrible but i didnt shake it well enough. So make sure to shake it well before using it. It does go with my skin color and i like it doesnt have strong odor. It also covers some of my face imperfections. Works good as a primer for me.,4
"This wig is going to be great to dress up as winnie from hocus pocus. Even though it doest cover my sude good enought it is still a good wig. The 2 clips stay on pretty good. And it comes with the accesories, love it.",4
Even though i dont like scented lotions that much this one is good. The scent it has is very nice. I can take this in my bag  and it does moisturizes my hand plus it leaves them smelling good.,4
[[VIDEOID:e755d7eeac7a1ab5fd83430a2e2ae613]] I got these for my watercolors which I make. They work perfet for it. Good quantity and good price.,4
"These are actually pretty nice and a good size to use on nails. Also great for my art projets, i like to paint with acrylic paint so these will look great on my art. They took a month to arrive so if you need them right away better think about it. They sont come with a case so ao you will haveto get one to store them.",4
smell nice. Unisex.,4
I did not like the individual packaging they didn’t really take down my swollen under eye bags and they were packaged separately and hard to get out of there a little packaging so I will not buy this againDid not like them. Also split upon application which is bad for an under eyepatch,1
"I am loving this product so far. It takes some getting used to and it isn’t quite as moisturizing, but it does keep my skin looking good. The cardboard tube can be composed when I am done!",5
There is a lot to like about these bobby pins. They are sturdy and come in multiple colors. They are pointed uniformly and seem to hold my hair well. Only issue I had was that they seem to grab my hair more than the drugstore brand ones that I am used to. Overall I think that more hair will get pulled out with these pins than my old ones.,4
"This deodorant has a very strong lavender scent (which is a plus for me!) It went on smooth, though it was difficult to get the plastic cover off of the stick for the first time. It did a surprisingly good job of keeping odors to a minimum, even in the middle of running errands in the heat of summer. Overall I was very impressed with this product.",5
"This is a really fun facial kit, and Lord knows that the way things have gone with covid we could all use more fun in our lives! This would be a perfect kit to send to your friends and have a spa day over zoom. It has everything you need to feel pampered and it is super affordable!",5
"The shaver is sharpe and shaves closely, making for a nice shave. It does not have the most sturdy or well built feel to it as it is all plastic, but it will be a good shaver for traveling with.",4
"Biore delivers again. I am very happy with its cleaning power. Not sure how much this will sell for, but I’d be willing pay about $6 for this.",4
Great nail polish. It contains acetone.,5
I don't really use this for my skin great for crafts and the little that's got on my skin made the areas soft,5
This was so inexpensive that I assumed it would be poor quality. Wow! Really nice and well made!! Bought one for my daughter who played a “Princess” at a birthday party and one for the birthday girl. Big hit!!,5
Compact.  Lights could have been brighter but overall good quality.,5
"Good price, great file.",5
Very happy with the purchase for this price. I am sure there are much more high quality brushes out there but on a budget this works.,4
"I got the retro red. It is a little bright but it is a nice color. Applied carefully, it looks nice on a light olive complexion. The lipstick is creamy but just enough to cover smoothly. It hasn't dried my lips so far.",4
"This is a great little gadget for cleaning dust and crumbs. It has a plus, a tube for spot cleaning. The suction is not very strong but is enough to do the job. The gray is a nice neutral color and should fit most decor.",5
"This is my first attempt at DIY lip gloss. I wanted something that was more moisturizing and in a color I wanted. The base blended well with oils, food grade mica and flavoring. I made a neutral tint with a touch of gold for shimmer. It feels nice on my lips. The gloss did not feel heavy and stayed on my lips. However, the mica color might be richer in clear rather than white. Overall, I am satisfied with my first attempt but I will order clear.",4
"If you have the patience to put these in and take them out carefully, then it is worth the extra time. This between a wig and a weave. The glue tabs are not bulky and can add volume to thin hair when layered. You will need more than one package for full coverage. I got these to fill out thinning hair. A wig is sometimes too hot to wear and a weave can be too painful. I can put these in and take them out when I am ready. There are plenty of videos about this. I got both off black and dark brown to match my hair color. This can be a fun way to get more fullness without spending hundreds of dollars.",4
"I bought the wrong product as I wanted nail lacquer and not gel. However, the colors are very pretty and I have a nail gel lamp, so I will keep them. My bottles have samples of the colors on the front. I have not tried them yet, but I hope they are as pretty as the photo.",4
Very nice palette but some of the colors did not survive shipping. The stay on well with eye primer. I need apply only once and they last all day.,4
My clients absolutely love these lashes. It can look so soft but yet can easily be made into a more dramatic LOOK! It's slightly longer than I expected but I am so pleased because its more spaced out gives it a natural look - stack 2 lashes & I promise you you'll love it if you're a drama girl.  Client with hat is one lash - Me with the swoop is stacked. @nudeebeats,5
Very even and fine spray,5
i plan on purchaseing two more love these fit well and nice to look at,5
just not what i expected but hold your hair well....,3
Great moisturizing lotion smells OK. Will try the lavender/ citrus scent next.,5
"I thought this would smell better but after using it a few days, a bad chemical odor began to annoy me.  The rose smell got cloying too.  Did not seem to benefit from use either.",3
These are great for the price. May be on the small side if you have super long hair but fits great on my thick shoulder length. Am buying another set for my mother.,5
I will list pros and cons for this review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Well made<br /><br />Cons:<br />Material is a little slippery<br />Squared ends<br />The second striped bow is actually a bright neon pink color with blue stripes (yuck),4
"I purchased this in order to test and review this scar cream. I am a breast cancer survivor, and have more than my share of scars, so any help in healing is very welcomed!<br /><br />I am not going to include photos until I have completed testing it for a month or longer to give it time to see if it works as promised, but I am giving a review of it so far. It arrived in great condition, and the bottle is easy to pump out the cream. The cream (I think it should be called lotion since it comes out of a pump though) is nice and light with a pleasant smell, and leaves the area nice and smooth.<br /><br />Time will tell as to the effectiveness it has on scars and stretch marks since it it still early in my testing, so I plan to return to update my review later and will include before and after photos as well.<br /><br />in a nutshell: so far, so good",4
"The bottle are a pretty fair quality, everything fits. I use them for my inks for crafting, and they have held up well. Took a little bit to receive, but it wasn't too long of a wait.",4
This wig is made fairly well. It’s sheds a lot and a little of the cap shows at the front of the wig. The fibers are nice and silky. I bought it for my Halloween costume and it’s perfect for that but not for daily wear.,3
Great to use and easy to change out,5
"The pallet I received contained concealer that does not spread evenly because it is very firm.  I have to either blend it with a dab of lotion or warm it up to use it, but I don't recommend the latter bc it settles in fine lines and makes wrinkles more prominent.  That said, it's a nice pallet and the colors were mostly true to the image shown--they are brighter, but similar.",3
"Quickly approaching (a still, sadly, rather vain) age 40, I have personally spent a small fortune over the years trying to slow the aging process and reverse the effects of too many days spent gardening without sunscreen.  I cannot even begin to list all the products I've somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book [[ASIN:0743292561 You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)]].  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.<br /><br />Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.<br /><br />I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).",5
"I bought the medium to store a mini tarot deck in its tin.  The measurements are about 3x4 inches, but did not fit in the medium.  There is SO MUCH padding!  Keep this in mind when looking at measurements!<br /><br />However, I am more than pleased and ordered a bigger size, and now have a use I didn’t plan on for the smaller one.  My husband is even impressed.",5
"I had one similar to this one but lost it.  This time, I bought two...one for me, one for my daughter as she sometimes forgets to shut her iron off.  I like it, could be a little longer length though, instead of a perfect square.",5
These basically look like I expected them to. They do stay in place a little bit but they don't hold the hair very well and since I have curly hair and they don't stay in place my hair kind of slipped back and forth and I ended up with frizzies in front which is kind of not the point of wearing a headband.  These are cheap enough that the few colors that I had planned on wearing were still worth purchasing even though there was a couple of colors that I'll never wear.,4
I would have liked an adjustable sprayer.  The kind you rotate between mist and a stream continuously.  This has off-mist-off-stream positions on the nozzle.  I didn't think about dropping the bottle and it potentially breaking either.  I'm glad for the glass because we use this for our hermit crabitat.,4
"My daughter likes this brush oh, but it's a little smaller and not quite as good of a quality as one I had like this prior that we lost. It does a good job untangling her hair which is long and thick with fine hair shafts that break easily, and a little bit wavy but mostly straight and silky.<br /><br />She hates brushing her hair but does like using this one.  I think the build quality could be a little better but it's acceptable and it does a good job.  The bright color also helps to find it in her messy room.",4
"Nope, didn't work at ALL! The elastic band didn't keep it closed. It wouldn't even stay on he other clip. Garbage.",1
It smells good but not quite the Pinrose in a bottle. All clothes were moist.,5
Good product does what it is supposed to. I don't like the pineapple taste. Not as soft as CVS brand.,4
Really helped in the stretching process!,5
"To me the shade on the product picture looks like it might have a little pink in it but I don't notice it when I apply it. Maybe that's just me 🤔 Regardless, I feel the shade is very pretty...and definitely is metallic.<br /><br />It's also very long-lasting- to the point that later when taking it off, I used both an oil cleanser and makeup remover. Transferring is minimal. It actually stays a little sticky the whole time while wearing it, so that makes it a little surprising that it's so long lasting- since many liquids dry completely. It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good. Has rich pigment and has a stand-out metallic look<br /><br />Packaging is pretty",4
I had never heard of this brand before and was also looking forward to trying this out because I feel like this shade wouldn't look right on me- I guess because I have a lot of redness in my face. So getting the opportunity to try it out allowed me to branch out and try a shade I would normally be hesitant to buy. I'm glad because I love it! I ended-up loving the shade and how it looks on me. It applies so smoothly and even feels moisturizing while wearing. I love the shimmer- it's enough to be noticeable and pretty but isn't too much. Happy with it!,5
"Very pretty, soft and the coloring looks even better in person. I feel it's a nice wig, especially for it being more of a costume/cosplay type wig and for the price",5
"The coloring looks really cool and pretty. I like that it's got the multiple colors, I personally haven't had many that do. The length and style combined with the colors is a lot of fun. It sheds a little. I try to be careful with the ends as they've been a little tangly but it's a costume wig so I often experience that with other costume wigs, especially with length and curls. Overall I really like it and think it looks good",4
"Soft and pretty. I really like the length and the ombre coloring looks good. Stays fastened pretty well on it's own, though, I use a wig-grip band and it keeps in place well. Great for cosplay, dress-up or just because🙌🏼",4
"The skin on my neck has lost a lot of elasticity. I wouldn't say it's in bad shape but I feel it is for being in mid 30s. Having health stuff going on, former daily tanning machine user, former smoker and my weight goes up-and-down- all things that have contributed to my skin changes and my neck is no exception. This cream is soothing and leaves a lot of moisturize but not a lot of goop. I feel like my skin looks smoother, though I'm sure more consistent and long-term use will bring the most benefits and results. The texture of it is so creamy and thick and feels great on! Arrived sealed and packaged-up really well.",5
"It's really cute and sparkly. Quality is fine but feels slightly off compared to other similar headbands in this price range that I've tried. Hopefully it holds up well, if taken care of. Slightly narrow fit but not too uncomfortable. Liking the look and color!",4
"Soft. Decent quality. Very pretty coloring with the black roots and silver-gray. The length and style look pretty, too. Fits good and is styled nicely. Looks good, overall like it!",5
"Having health issues that causes very dry skin, I appreciate a lotion with better ingredients and moisturizing. This one isn't as thick as some but it's doing the job hydrating. It's a great size too!",4
"This is definitely a statement headband! For whatever you decide to use it for, it's big (thick/height wise), flashy and very noticeable…yet very pretty and has a lot of bling 🙌🏽 My 10 year old loves it too and says it's like a queen's headband. The soft lining underneath does help make it comfortable and it fits well!",5
"Used this on a PS4 Pro and it worked great- clear sound from the game and in chatting. It's bulky but not heavy and comfortable to wear- even for hours at a time. The mic is a good length and able to bend a bit, if needed. The cord seems durable and connected well to the PS4 controller. The controls for the headset itself all work good. All around, a good headset 👍",5
I ended up dying mine black because I naturally have very dark hair and I was tired of maintaining the lighter color with bleaching and all that jazz. These actually were very easy to dye and look great! I didn't glue mine in I ended up using some clip-in extension pieces and making a ponytail extension out of it. It looks great and the hair is really excellent quality.<br /><br />If you are using them as glue in extensions you will definitely need at LEAST 4 sets of these to get a decent amount of hair throughout your head. It's just not enough otherwise.,5
This is a must-have especially during the winter when the wind hits your lips and they become dry and chapped. It gets all the dry flaky dead skin off of your lips leaving them super soft and supple. Not the mention the product itself smells and tastes great. 10/10!,5
"I don't know what it is about goat milk soap/cleansers, but they are so luxurious! This is no exception. I have a pre-teen daughter who is on the cusp of puberty and has been suffering from a little acne. She has extremely sensitive skin so this face wash was the perfect option for her. It has kept her face clear from blemishes without drying out her skin.",5
I'm not even going to lie to ya'll... I wear my mascara thick with multiple layers. This makes it SO hard for me to get off. It's not unusual for me to accidentally pull out my eyelashes trying to get my mascara off. This has left my eyelashes looking very sad. I decided to give this a go and I think I see results. My problem is I am defeating the purpose by wearing too much mascara! I think I just need to invest in some fake lashes.,4
If you are an ashy kind of gal then you need some body in your life!<br /><br />I'm always up for trying something new so I was excited to try this ULTRA LIGHT FULL SPECTRUM BODY OIL.<br /><br />I think it works best if you put it on while your skin is still damp right out of the bath or a shower. I also try to exfoliate a little bit especially on my legs and other problem areas like elbows and knees.<br /><br />It's lightly scented which I like because if it's too overpowering it can really flare up my allergies.<br /><br />I wouldn't use something like this on my face because I do tend to be on the oily side. But for the body it really works great!,5
I love having this Rose Quartz Roller Face Massager for applying all types of face masks and treatments to the face.<br /><br />When I put a facemask on I like to roll this over it. The rose quartz feels cool and it just feels so refreshing on the face and neck. It's also easy to clean which is nice.  I also apply some lotions / creams with it. I like to apply my hyaluronic acid with this. It seems like it works better than using my fingers alone.<br /><br />What has really impressed me though is the Microneedle Derma Roller. I only use it a few times a week but I really feel like it has helped with my dry flaky skin around my t-zone which has always been a problem for me. My face has never looked better!!,5
I think the pony tail holders may work for my little girls but the clips - definitely not. The clips are literally all the same just with different accessories glued on. I'm sure my girls will be able to use them on their dolls. Such a shame. The organizer box though is nice! I'm sure I'll be able to use it for something else.,3
"I just wan't ya'll to know.. I have never given myself a gel polish manicure in my LIFE before yesterday. I had been wanting to for the longest time, but I wasn't 100% prepared to make the commitment to purchasing the light and the top coats and the bottom coats and the paint, etc, etc..<br /><br />Well if you are on the fence, jump it!<br /><br />First of all, the lamp works. You set your timer and once you do that, all you have to do is put your hand it and it starts automatically. Awesome! Like a real salon.  I was able to do my hands in 45 minutes. It would have been even faster but I did a test run on my thumb before doing them all at once to make sure I didn't mess anything up.<br /><br />Overall, I am SO happy to have this nail curing lamp!",5
Great stencils im just mad that I only like one stencil for my face features.,4
Great bundles. These bundles Are super soft and truths in length. The hair did not have a smell. I did not wash it before installing. The hair is<br />Silky And Staight.,5
"I thought this would ne a waste, but boy was I wrong.  I love the shapes of the brow stamps and how they are fool proof.  The color stays on all day long and even through sweat and constantly touching my face.  I love it",5
"Man let me tell you that this closure is not it.  It was beat once I bleached the knots it napped up so much I had to order another closure.  The bundles are not true to length and have way too many split ends, after I cut the ends it was more of 14-16 inch bundles.  The ends are nappy and it leads me to believe that the hair is a blend of human /synthetic.",2
TOOOOOO many split ends.  already crunchy.  Do not bleach,2
great for dry scalp.  Makes my 4c hair shine and more manageable.  will order more,4
I use this faithfully on my girly areas and it get it baby soft no stubble.  Love it.  I can use it in the shower or in front the mirror.  Great battery life/  Oh he likes it too but we fight over it so I am just gonna order another.,5
"This is most definitely not satisfied with product. I tried to bleach hair but color didn’t left. The bundles did have a nice texture to them but hair did not take the color dye and it melted.  Its not 100% human, it is a blend.  be careful",2
"Not enough color for me, and it wipes right off.  In this summer weather it is a must to have you makeup stay and last all day,  my brows were gone in 2 hours.",1
"What an absolutely beautiful mannequin head.  The quality is excellent  just like a living Barbie doll like quality. The eyelashes are actual fibers, not just painted on and her eyes are beautiful.  They did an incredible job with the makeup on this mannequin, but me being me I changed it. She even has pierced ears, love it.  This is the 2nd one of these that I have gotten for a display and she is as beautiful as the other.",5
"Bundles !!! Great hair, no smell, no shedding, no ragged ends.  Hair lasted about 3 weeks then got nappy at the ends.  I would not recommend bleaching.  Its ok quality, hair you get in a pinch when you have an event to attend.  Not birthday hair.  lol",5
"Good colors but I needed 3 coates with these small bottles it will be gone in no time.  Love these colors, so vibrant and feels like spring. Easy to apply, easy to take off - gel polish has slowly made its way into my heart. I love them.",4
Great hold for lace wigs.,4
"Didn’t work for me.  I guess you must have kind of thick brows to begin because painting skin is not good,  it peeled right off leaving no trace of brow.  too thick to not peel off.  im perplexed",2
Smaller than displayed. Hair started to unravels upon removal out the pack. It was a hot mess!  Cannot cut them,2
"Awesome product.  Yes the smell is terrible and the ingredients are no better, but I may say it gets my 4c hair straight and keeps me from flat ironing it daily.  Its a lot of steps and not for the faint of heart.  It works for me.  It kept my hair straight for at least 2-3 months and then my curls reverted back slowly.  Will buy again.",4
"I have lost a lot of hair and I can see in my hairline that it was thinning badly, my mom has the same issue and is fully bald in her crown.  I tried all products like rogain and pills. And I found this beauty and omg after just two weeks I see little hair growing in my thinning hairline and now 3 months later and 3 bottle of the hair serum later my hair grow back to normal thank you again very good product and costumers service",4
"Makes my hair fuller, and I did like the scent and how easy it was to use. I didn't like how small the bottle is, how much you have to use to get my hair coated, however it doesn't clean well, and gave my hair any extra volume.",3
"Not full human hair, its ugly and I cant even tell what is the front or the back.",4
"my curls do not last, but it heats up quickly but for some reason my curls will not last.",3
Lord this hair is nappy  DO NOT BUY,4
"I cut it, did a curl set and steamed the curls with a clothing steamer to set and brushed out.<br />The shade of blonde is very pretty, it is sort of a lightest ash blonde, not entirely platinum but not as yellow as a #613.",5
I love the size and shape of this flat iron. I’m able to get close to my roots to make my hair silky straight. This size is perfect for long hair and cuts my flat ironing time in half. All it takes is one pass of the iron to make my hair straight.  Love that it has auto shut off,5
"This hair is amazing! Doesn't tangle easy, easy to braid, and after dipping, they hardly fuzz. I've used other brands, and this is by far the best for the price. Will definitely buy again.",4
This is by far the best toothbrush ever.  The bristles are super soft and get my teeth and gums clean.  I will purchase over and over again.  I will never change this is the best brush I have ever had the pleasure of using.  This is even better than the electric toothbrush.  Please do not hesitate to buy you will not be disappointed.,5
"cute colors for fall.  Only 2 coats needed.  Nice,  opaque gel polishes that last! All are very unique and perfect neutrals. the shade names are  the color of the shade inside the bottle which is helpful, but the are not stuck on the bottle very well.  Nice size bottles.",3
"I am very happy with this product! There is definitely a learning curve at first but once you get the hang of it it's easy! it’s not as easy as it looks. You’ll have to figure out a good technique that works. I have thick curly hair, I use it after I straighten it, my hair has yet to get tangled in it.",4
"Cheap, Very soft, good quality Marley hair.  I buy braiding hair on Amazon a lot but, never keep track of which I buy. This is my second purchase, different color first time for ombre. I love this hair and it's easy to install.  No itching or irritation to my scalp.  Good smell and color",4
"Did the individual crochet method and loved it.  Some of the twists are bigger/smaller, used the larger in the back.  You will need additional packs if you want a full head.  Love the inches",5
Makes the most hilarious eyebrows.  I am going to try on someone else maybe thats the issue.  The stencils are too long I have thin short brows and this does not fit my face at all.  Package arrived on time is about this best thing about this product.  Sorry but NO!!!!,2
I use these containers for very thing when we on vacation from lotions to sprays,5
"cute but thing.  I ordered an additional pack to make it fuller, but that is all I have to complain about.  Others may like it as it is but I prefer big and full hair.  I will order a 26 or 28 inch to make it full and long.  I always wanted a bang wig.",4
"These eyelashes are not for the daily wearer. If you’re looking for dramatic, extremely voluptuous eyelashes, these are the ones you need to buy. For those that are looking for everyday wear that looks natural, I would advise you to look at the wispy type. They have  cross hairs patter that look gorgeous. They lasted for over a week and I slept in them",4
"This did nothing for my edges or flyways.  Maybe I can use it for my brows to make them lay smooth,  other than that its useless for AA hair types.  It does smooth down the edges but they do not stay put for more than and hour.  It might for in a pinch if you forget to lay your edges .",2
"Great ombre braiding hair.  not to many snags, or tangles while braiding.  It dips well and is able to hold a curl for a very long time.  This was enough to do my cousin entire head.  Love it, will order more",3
"I use this to tone my closures after I bleach them.  works like a charm to take the redness or orange out of the hair.  works like a dream and it makes the hair much softer after bleaching, I did not get the crunchy roots.",4
It has more of a masculine scent to me.  It does not last for a long period of time.  It has an earthy texture and does not mix with my body scent at all.  I do not like it,3
"Do not be alarmed by the peeling or non peeling, it took a few days to get my feet to peel.  When they finally did peel it left my feet looking younger and softer.  I will purchase again",4
Heats up fast and has extreme drying power it dries my hair in 15 minutes instead of the usual 30-40 minutes to dry my thick hair.  Gets my hair shiny.,5
This is super cute but its needs some tlc.  It needs to be thinned out and layered for my liking. If you are able to do that this can be a great unit.  I thinned out the sides and layered the top.  Its really cute now.  Its synthetic and not a lace wig but you can make it look catural.,5
"They ok, not the best lashes..... I like em full and long.  these are church lashes (LOL)  but they work, they stick to your eyes momentarily they last about 2 days whereas my usual lashes last for about 4-7 days.  Says reusable but you will have to clean them well.",3
"I use this for sun burns, and other burns.  I also use on my face and skin to calm down my irritation after wearing a face mask for 12-16 hours a day while at work.  I place a quarter size amount in my hand ans massage through my skin.  It soothes my face and leaves my skins feeling soft and supple.  I love this stuff",5
"These are fashion lashes, not for daily use.  They are very long and noticeable.  Great for nights out and picture taking.  Not really intended for work or school.  They are easy to put on and take off, but they rip easily.  They are very dramatic and long so be aware.",3
"Great for daily wear, I even sleep in them.  They come off easily when I need to remove and do not pull my own lashes out.  They do not feel like mink lashes and seem more of a plastic feel, but are soft and mimic mink lashes great.  They are think and luscious but are not cartoony.  I have had this pair on for 4 days now and still look great.  Everyone thinks I put them on daily but, nope I sleep in them and they do not get bent, fold, or lift while I sleep. They are easy to put on, I prefer using hair glue and install them directly above my lash line to prevent my lashes from being removed.  I will order more.",4
Good lashes but not dramatic enough for me.  They are lightweight and stay on for at least a week almost two.  The length is good but the drama isnt there.  These are good for everyday use for me.  I would buy again.,4
"Great lashes, soft and east to put on.  they look so real and make my eyes pop.  I have used them several times and they do not fall off easily.  Very full and dramatic but natural.  Love them.  will purchase more.",5
I was very hopeful for this item but sorry it does not work for me I have oily skin and they do not stick after a while.,1
I am more of a thick hair girl so I was not amazed at this wig.  I have a large head so the wig looks very thin on me.  The construction is superb and the  knots are bleached and the hairline plucked.  perfect if you have a thin face.  The length is fine,3
"got this to add to my bundles,  HORRIBLE, sheds, is nappy, and brittle, I have never had  closure this awful.  EVER.  I wet it every hour and as soon as i look n the mirror its poofy, nappy, and ZERO waves.  I wish i could return.  PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THIS CLOSURE!!!!!!!!!!!  ive had it for two weeks installed. and cant take it anymore.  i am replacing the closure this weekend",1
its balding,2
i purchased this to match other hair.  blended perfectly.,3
"bundles are thin.  i have an undercut and both sides shaved  i used all except 1/2 bundle.  hair sheds, ends are thin.  so thin in fact i cut off about  4 inches off the ends.  it doesn't tangle that much.  no smell.  hair is dry and doesnt hold curls well.  the curl patter fell straight out the pack.  the hair is not true to length.  the 28 is more like 24 and after cutting the ends its like 20.  not the best or worst.  wont purchase again",2
good,5
"the bundles are ok. I bleached them and died them and they are still soft.  received the same day which was awesome for hair.  If u need in a hurry this is the place.  true to length ( in spots), no odor, bleached the knots and did not thin out the hairline it was ok.  The frontal was super large, which i found crazy cause i have a large head.  but better it be big than small and tight.  Overall a good purchase for my first wig making adventure.  probably would order again if the seller can guarantee the frontal and bundles match.<br /><br />Update:  a month after I have made my wig, the 360 frontal holding up.  the bundles are ok.  I have died and fried this hair many times.  it is holding well.",4
"This product is a lifesaver for me. A lifesaver of hiding embarrassing ugly marks. I was getting horrible cystic type boils on my neck. I wore turtle necks as long the season would allow. I discovered this stuff and it covers them so well, you can't even tell there is red/purple marks or new sore ones! You can of course see some bumps but blending the color with my skin, it's not noticeable. It also helps to heal them and I've been getting less and less and the year went on. Now I use more sporadically, to hide what scars are left but this product seems to help them fade! If I apply it when I feel one coming on, it helps to reduce the inflammation and rids it quicker. That could really be because there is green tea in it.  My daughter uses it to hide her teen acne and in fact my son puts a teeny tiny drop on his cystic spots as well to tone down the redness. You  truly cannot tell it is even makeup.We are fair, freckled and use the lightest one.  WELL WORTH it.",5
"My husband used this kit and took, when asked to do a bit of a review on it for me, took it very seriously. The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />""You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.""<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set. He's still talking about it so he did like it, just thought it was a bit much.",4
"This is an excellent shampoo and conditioner set. It's nearly perfect. I'm putting this at a 4.5. Now I don't know if this is just my hair being obnoxiously dry or not but that would be the only thing that I could say anything remotely ""bad"" about. The conditioning was just not quite enough on the ends of my hair. Great on the already healthy stuff, just seemed to ignore the drier ends. Figured I'd get that over with and move on to the good stuff.<br />This really gave my hair a nice shine to it. My hair is getting old with me and it no longer wants to be as manageable and tame as it once was. With this duo of delight my hair looked healthy after it dried. It looked good when left to air dry, when dried with the hot air brush, and when left to air dry. It looked shiny without the added matching shine spray (which is also a wonderful product) and with. I left out the word smooth in this so far but let me tell you! It was also smooth and sleek without having to use other products to make it stay that way. Granted, under all that grey old hair there has always been fairly thin straight hair so this just really put it back to looking like it used to in that regard. The shampoo cleaned it to the point of being squeaky clean as well.<br />Give this duet a try if you can. It works really well and smells alright to boot!",4
"My husband is the one that used this because he was going through a rough patch. He is more prone to acne than I am and recently he's been getting more and more breakouts. I asked him to let me know how he felt about it after using it. Here is what he had to say about it:<br /><br />""So like many people i have been wearing a mask all day. It's hot and it becomes humid under the mask. Perfect breeding place for acne. It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to complain about it. Just that's how it is now, and we have to work with it.<br />This serum seemed to be working at first. It's easy to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it dry in.<br />You will notice when you use it that your skin appears to be tightening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will lighten and eventually fade.<br />I had to stop using it. I believe it was working at first but after some continued use it was making things worse and the acne was spreading. I have a slightly oily skin type and this may not have been best suited to me.<br />Glad I tried it and I have a feeling that it may work better for a different skin type than mine.""<br /><br />There you have it. That's what he thought about it.",3
"This is a very good set of brushes and combs, especially for the price. They work great. You get four things in this set. You'll receive a paddle brush, a rectangle comb, a detangler hair brush, and a tail comb. I don't really use the combs as much as the brushes but did give them a bit of a testing so I could type a review. I absolutely love all of these brushes and combs. They are sturdy and work very well. When used for what they are supposed to be used for specifically I thought they all held up well and did their jobs. They detangled perfectly and when used for styling they were easy to hold on to, didn't get in the way at all, and worked the hair into it's style nicely.<br />I would recommend these if you are looking for a good set of hair brushes and combs that won't cost you much. These are terrific for that!",5
These are terrific! I really like these hemp and rose under eye mask patches. If you have puffy tired eyes that crave some tender loving care then these just may be what you need. They work so well. You put them on under your eyes after washing and drying your face. Just leave them on for 10-15 minutes and when you remove them you gently massage the product into the skin. That's it!<br />The one thing that isn't so great is that they are so hard to separate when you first open the packet and take them out. They stick together and to themselves and it's very frustrating trying to get them without losing the liquid and getting yourself all covered in it. Other than that these are a definite win.,4
"My husband put this kit to good use so I asked him if he'd mind letting me know what he thought about it. He didn't mind at all and this is what he had to say:<br /><br />""Very comprehensive, quality kit for men. If you're like me you will find there are items in here that you likely won't really need. I personally don't use hair pomade or those light shave creams. I prefer foam and my hair just sort of keeps my head warm.<br />Aside from the items I can't use there are some great items in here for everyone. The body scrub soap like and feel a good bit more fresh after using it. But my preference, and where I really came to appreciate this, was with the facial moisturizer and lip balm. I don't usually buy those items and let the winter have its way with my face. I ride a bike everyday. But using the items in this kit really helped me keep my skin from drying, and my lips. The lip balm tastes and smells great, too.""<br /><br />That's what he had to say about it. He did genuinely seem to enjoy using this kit.",4
I really like this face wash. It's one of the most gentle washes I've ever used. It has the lightest smell of cucumber which I don't like too much but at the same time it is a refreshing clean smell and it isn't overwhelmingly strong. It seems odd to give a five star to something with a scent that isn't quite one that is liked but this is a very good face wash and I absolutely love how clean it leaves my face feeling. It doesn't cause a red face or breakouts. It does seem to help prevent acne and even help to minimize it when it happens. It's definitely a new favorite.,5
"These headbands are fantastic. There are 9 in this set and they come in a variety of colors and designs. You get three velvet headbands with pearls- pink, black, and beige, 3 fabric headbands- 2 have flower patterns and one is black with white stripes, and three knitted- green, grey, and black.<br />These are very well constructed. The only thing is that after a little while they did begin to dig in bit where they rest at the ends. Not too much but enough to make it uncomfortable after a long period of time. They still so nice it's worth the slight suffering.<br />These are very nice and worth it.",4
"This shampoo and conditioner leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and manageable after the first use. It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like ""restore"" and ""fortify"". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a leave in conditioner or separate type of moisture just because it's winter my hair is increasingly dry on any given day depending. I can't tell for sure about the breakage but it does seem stronger. I suppose in many ways they go hand in hand. It has more pull to it so it's not snapping and breaking as much.<br />I like this. A little goes a long way as well which is nice.",5
"Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of this one. It didn't do much to help my lips. Rather than exfoliate it actually just seemed to dry out my lips and not just a little bit. It wasn't fun. I tried it a few times, as directed. Just apply a small pea-sized amount to the lips using a finger-tip, scrub gently in a circular motion to remove the dead skin cells for about 30 seconds then rinse or eat off remaining sugar. All of that was done, rinsed not eaten though the one thing that was good was that it didn't taste half bad. Alas, my poor lips were left in worse shape than ever. Dry and roughed up. No matter how hard or gentle I used the stuff over a three week period. I finally gave up and had to admit defeat. Perhaps others had better luck?",2
"This mask is very nice. I have never used a mask like this one before. It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can. Perhaps in summer as they have a nice cooling feel to them that I bet would feel great in the summer heat!",4
"(3.5)<br />Beautiful scrunchies. These scrunchies are very nice. They are made from 100% real natural raw mulberry silk. What makes these special is that they are not supposed to pull your hair as much or get stuck like many others do. That is true of these! The scrunchie works great. It goes in nicely, holds the hair back, doesn't slide out, and when it's taken out there is little to no hair caught in it.<br />However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed less hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there. It's a good scrunchie but it's truly up to you if you'd spend that much on one. Maybe the other options make the prices seem less daunting?",3
This body scrub is really nice.  It smells so good and it smooths the and nourishes the skin perfectly. When you rub this gently onto your skin then rinse it off you can instantly feel the difference. It feels as if all the dead skin has been removed and your pores have been opened. It leaves you soft and refreshed as well as incredibly relaxed.<br />This is a big jar as well that you get and it's worth it for the price. It's definitely worth giving a try if you are interested and able to. It's really good. I love it.,5
"These underarm sweat pads are just the thing for that extra protection in times of need! Sometimes no matter how much or what kind of deodorant you use, you just can't seem to stop the unsightly and ever so embarrassing pit stain of doom.  With these placed in your shirt the sweat never reaches your shirt and your garments are saved!<br />These work very well. To use them you simply lay your shirt down flat, remove the covering over the adhesive, place firmly in the spot needed, and you are good to go. When you are going to take it off remember to very gently remove it because it can become pretty sticky. It mentions this when you read about the product above but it is worth the reminder here!<br />These work very well and are a good option if you have problems often or occasionally with sweaty underarms.",4
"A few things here …<br /><br />LES ENFANTS is French for CHILDREN<br /><br />It doesn’t refer to infants or toddlers. For those who don’t know, a quick note …<br /><br />Newborn – birth to 4 weeks<br />Infants – 4 weeks to 1 year<br />Toddler – 1-3<br />Preschooler – 3-5<br />Child – 6-13<br /><br />That said …<br /><br />It does state NOT TO SPRAY IT ON A BABY’S SKIN. “Applying gently on clothes” is the preferred method. Though to be honest, I’d say this is more for ages 6+<br /><br />While baby cologne isn’t something I would use on a baby, it could be better for adults who want a light scent and not overwhelmed by a perfume.<br /><br />For almost $30, this is an 8.5 fl oz spray. Compared to some perfumes and colognes, this is moderately priced.<br /><br />Smell? It isn’t the greatest. I do like it as a light, after-bathing scent. It seems more suited to a room freshener than a perfume. But, it isn’t the WORST perfume/scent I’ve smelled.<br /><br />The generous size means it will last a while.<br /><br />Would I get it again? No. Nor would I recommend it either.",3
"I honestly don’t even know WHERE to begin with this review 🤷🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I have, in my lifetime – and, wearing “fake” nails for OVER 25 YEARS – NEVER seen this type of … idea 🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I’ll be as short as possible with this …<br /><br />Most anyone who hasn’t had an amputation, usually has 8 fingers and 2 thumbs – total of 10 “DIGITS” ✋🏻🤚🏻 And, in MOST cases – the nails are usually shaped the same.<br /><br />Thus, in a set of nails you’d need:<br /><br />💅🏻 2 – Thumb nails<br />💅🏻 2 – Index fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Middle fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Ring fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Pinkie fingernails<br /><br />I know – sounds almost silly or stupid to mention, but that’s math. Total “NAILS” needed: 10 … (“Luxury 12pcs press on nails kit comes with 10 different sizes which is pre-numbered 0-9 in a box” … “choose the most suitable size that fits you every finger”). Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we’re NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I’ve bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you’ll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke? This is a set of TWELVE (12) nails – 10 different sizes! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />Unlike the model hands – I don’t wear my nails OVER the edges of my finger. That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with – and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being “fake”, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular “nails” I’ve seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N’ Wild from the late 1980’s/early 1990’.<br /><br />What’s worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I’ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep – they’re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I’d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price – I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn’t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them. The seller might have a better set out there, but not this selection.",1
This is an exfoliating facial cleanser that really didn't feel that great or give me that much in benefits. For $23 it is not something I'd get again or recommend. It was slightly overpriced and overhyped.,3
"This is, for less than $10, a lovely comb.<br /><br />Can function at a wedding or other event. However, the cons outweigh the beauty.<br /><br />Given how delicate this is, there is NO storage box or bag. So, after use – where does one put it? That is an issue for me. Even a simple velvet type bag would be a good idea.<br /><br />Second? The comb itself.<br /><br />While absolutely stunning in design – function is a bit questionable because of the construction. The combs are “OPEN” design – thus loose hairs can weave in, particularly those with thick and curly hair. This makes removal or readjusting a bit difficult if not a tad uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is also for thicker hair, not thin, and thus circles back to the issue I just presented.<br /><br />While pretty, it isn’t something I am particularly pleased with. It isn’t something I would get for myself again. I also wouldn’t give it as a gift.",3
"I think a lot of us want an easier way to remove hair. Shaving, especially for a bigger girl like me, is not that easy. It’s worse when you have long legs, short arms.<br /><br />It’s bad when you have certain chin hairs (thankfully not that much it isn’t manageable another way).<br /><br />I tried some sugar wax kit back about 20+ years ago. That was a NIGHTMARE! It was supposedly edible. I think you microwaved the container, spread it on, let it cool, used a paper strip (supplied) to remove the hair. It didn’t work and stung.<br /><br />I then moved to a hair removal cream, that partially worked.<br /><br />After that? Back to the hold stand-by –> shave foam/cream and a razor. For my main body parts, that’s always worked. Tough “chin” hairs –> using a tweezer work. No, the dermaplaning tool didn’t work on them.<br /><br />I got a wax warmer, so I thought all beads/beans were equal.<br /><br />These came with ZERO instructions, and the after spray bottle was busted. The warmer kit at least had some. And, my warmer kit had specially made, disposable “cups”.<br /><br />These beads/beans, in a smaller cup, took over 90 minute to melt. And, the warmer was on 180°(F).<br /><br />I tried a small amount on my arm. The wax was sticky, not liquidy, and it cooled almost as soon as it hit my skin.<br /><br />I let it sit there for a few minutes (over 5), and peeled the max off. It didn’t hurt, sting, or cause redness – then again …<br /><br />THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE<br /><br />Okay, so my hair on my arm is a little thin. But, if this removes thick hair, shouldn’t it remove thinner hair?<br /><br />I found another patch, got some warm wax – tried it again. Nope. Tried legs, arms, and under my chin. Nothing. Then again, I see I'm not the only one experiencing issues with these beads/beans.<br /><br />I may have gotten a bad batch. But, I definitely wouldn’t get these again.",1
"As most have said here – these are great for travel, especially when you can’t find soap around but have water. Though I wouldn’t carry a bar of soap, I have used “travel” size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don’t intend to travel where I won’t have soap. So, I’m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me – it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don’t really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don’t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these go years – if you’re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they’re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That’s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.",3
"This product as a lot going for it. I love the idea of the individually gift boxed tubes, the cap is wonderful (huge and easy to use), the product is generously sized.<br /><br />The problem is that this stuff is runny, doesn’t absorb that well on me, and the “scent” that is there – it isn’t that great.<br /><br />For $15 before tax, that is roughly $3.75 a tube, and while they’re smaller – I’d honestly stick with Bath & Body Works.<br /><br />This isn’t something I’d get again and I wouldn’t recommend it. I also wouldn’t give it as a gift.",3

Simple to use – plug in, turn on, heat up, section hair, and use – put hair in, count down.<br /><br />Works in theory, fails in execution. First up – there is NO heat seating guide for SAFE curling. THIS DEVICE IS CELSIUS (C) ONLY, NO FARENHEIT (F) OPTION. Google is strongly needed here.<br /><br />According to Redken: “For those with fine or thin hair, keep your iron set below 200 (so below 100°C on this device) degrees Fahrenheit. Any higher and your strands may burn. For those with coarse or thicker hair, have your curling iron set between 200 degrees and 300 degrees (148.9°C or on this device 150) Fahrenheit for optimal curls” [9 Curling Iron Secrets You Need to Know About/Redken]<br /><br />Using that, as well as Glamour’s 8-10 second rule [How to Curl Your Hair Correctly: 7 Mistakes to Avoid – Glamour; “Drill it into your brain: You should hold an iron on your hair for eight to 10 seconds max”], along with using thinner groups of hair – I should have SOME wave. Nope. I even went 25 seconds. Nothing.<br /><br />As my hair has become a bit thinner, has been color treated, and exposed to SO much – I wasn’t about to turn this up hotter.<br /><br />The curler is designed much like a crimper, but the “width” can make it difficult to handle, especially by yourself. There is a “guard” which heats up as well and it is easy to burn yourself.<br /><br />It wins with innovative idea as well as the digital temp gauge. Also, it does heat up SUPER fast, as well as cool down just as fast when lowering the temp.<br /><br />For use by myself – this is a two star deal.

"I mainly got these for a “home-made” gel soak off (using foil).<br /><br />And, they worked! They don’t pinch at all; even my mom used them and said she could barely feel them.<br /><br />Light weight and fairly durable. There are enough for two people to use at the same time, or extras on hand if they ever break.<br /><br />If used for poly gels, I’m sure they would work just as well.",4
"Pretty standard nail drill.<br /><br />This is similar, if not identical to most of the nail drills used in the salon.<br /><br />Best used to remove gel polishes and/or nail tips to prepare them for other polishes or plain removal.",4
"Thank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set – I had to get it.<br /><br />I don’t know about others’ experiences – mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little “gel pots”. I remembered what my nail techs used to use – small make-up brushes – and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments – I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn’t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven’t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I’m not too unhappy with it. It’s not something I would likely purchase again.",3
"i have long, very thick hair as all my daughters do too and we like to keep our hair up most of the time.  I have many many clips and most of them are not good.  I always break the spring in the clip or one of the teeth.  These are metal and a cute design and not too heavy.  They grab the hair and then they really don't move.  No sliding down, or shifting around,.  They are easy to grip, open and place in the hair.  They do open nice and wide too. What i like is that the teeth meet under the hair.  when you have thick hair, sometimes the clips don't close around the hair tightly becuase the spring is too weak.  this has a nice strong spring so it snaps back closed and around the hair and holds it in place.",5
"***I received this item for free on the condition I provide an honest review****<br />First, this bag is BIG! But not too big. If you see the photos, it's bigger than the 16.9 ounce water bottle. It has a easy to use zipper with no rough spots. The embellishments are nicely done and affixed snuggly. The material is soft but sturdy and the shade of pink is fabulous.<br />This would be ideal for travel or everyday in a larger tote.<br />Great price point!",5
"This is a gentle and hydrating mask. Even though it has a retinol alternative, you can use it over a stronger serum. This is almost like a sleep mask, not all of it absorbs, it keeps a protective layer on your face while you sleep. It really hydrates so you look rested even if you aren’t.",4
I love the smell of this and is is very hydrating. The only issue is that it is so thick that it is hard to squeeze it out from the bottle. You need 2 strong hands to get it out. This is definitely annoying.,4
"This is great eye cream, it hydrates and erases fine lines. It even gives a bit of a glow and looks great under makeup. The cream is thick and rich, one of the best I’ve ever used. And it will last a long time!",5
"Thin Bamboo Sheet Sap infused sheet facee masks with rice essence extract cream for intensive moisturizing for pore reduction for all skin types, product made in Korea<br />The Power of Rice, for Your Skin care : With an innovative delivery system, this Korean Rice Cream Topping facial mask sheet actively works to deliver the skin enhancing power of our proprietary hydrating Rice Extract Cream faster and deeper to restore suppleness and moisture.<br />This is a pretty neat idea for a mask. The mask is soaked in serum, you put this on and then you add the rice cream on top so it soaks into your skin after the serum does. It’s quite hydrating and soothing.",4
"I really like this line. I see improvements using the exfoliating scrub, the toning serum and my favorite is the hydra-whipped moisturizer.  The scrub and the serum are also sold separately in full size bottles but the hydra-whipped is not and I'm so hoping it will be in the future. It absorbs without a trace of residue and the benefits are long lasting.<br />The only thing that did not wow me was the eye cream. It is pretty basic, offers some hydration.",4
"I’ve never tried anything like this product before. You put it on, wait 5 minutes and then wash your face with it. Over time it really does make my skin look clearer and brighter. I don’t use this daily, just a couple times a week. It could be used daily though but it is kind of expensive.",5
"Omg these are wonderful. I used to rub ice over my face in the morning years ago. This is much better. It’s nice to have 4 to keto cold but I have not had to use more than one at a time. They stay cold for with a while. When it feels like it isn’t cold, I roll it a little with my finger and then it’s fine. This is a fantastic tool to use in the morning especially if you have puffy eyes. I like using it before I put on make up. At night I will sometimes use it after I put my serums  and moisturizer on. It’s very relaxing.",5
"This isn’t the strongest vitamin c cream I’ve used but it is better than most serums. I seem to see better results with lotions like this. I’m not sure if the lemon adds anything, the aloe might be why I can use this daily without irritation. It is gentle enough for day use though you might want to use sunscreen with it.",4
I love this mask. It is very hydrating and the mask is thicker than most and clings very well.  The benefits last much longer than others I have used. This is by far one of my favorite masks and it’sa good deal for the price.,5
"Although I wish this body wash was more sudsy, it smells delightful, a nice burst of sunshine in winter. It is hydrating but not enough for dry winter, it’s probably going to be fine on summer months. The scent really is luscious!",4
"This retina serum, more like a cream, is very gentle so if this isn’t something you normally use due to redness or sensitivity this might be a good product for you. Results will be much slower but you won’t have peeling skin or dryness. This is also hydrating so it’ss good mix of ingredients to make it perfect for sensitive skin. It works well but I’m not noticing any brightness to my skin.",4
I love this mask almost as much as an avocado sheet mask I have. It really hydrates your skin and it is so soothing. I’ll be buying more of these for certain. I used this after a chemical peel that I use and it really took care of the usual redness I get.,5
This is one of the better HA products that I’ve used. It’s great for keeping my skin hydrated all day and hiding fine lines. Can be used at night and in the morning under make up.,5
I don’t know about you but I have been having dry hands from lots of hand sanitizer. And my poor cuticles. This hand cream is very rich and hydrating without leaving any greasy residue or taking forever to absorb. This is excellent quality hand cream and my hands are getting better. I only need to use it once or twice a day.,5
"I just recently started using the paper charcoal bubble masks but I do love peel off masks even more. I put on a medium layer of this and after a few minutes it starts to bubble. Unlike with the paper masks it was almost too tingly that made me want to just wash it off. But it went away after a few more minutes and then I just had to wait for it to dry. Maybe 20 minutes total. I like to leave peel off masks on longer to tighten my pores. It came of in just a couple pieces which was unusual, usually you have all these scraps left on. My skin looked and felt very fresh after.",4
"This is a very hydrating gel-cream moisturizer. It’s light and absorbs well.  It lasts all day, I think it is perfect for morning use under makeup. I like the green color too. It’s almost as good as Moisture Surge, better than the similar gel cream by Neutrogena. I’d definitely use this on an ongoing basis. Highly recommend!",5
"These bubble masks are so fun. I like the tingly way they feel while they get all foamy. My face feels super clean afterwords and brighter. It feels messy but it isn’t really, I didn’t get anything on my clothes. This is perfect for the end of a long week when your pores feel clogged. I don’t know if there is any long term benefits but I like them.",4
"This is a small oil diffuser than others I have seen or used but it is very nice and looks better in person than in pictures. The light design is nice but too much for me when I’m sleeping. You have to turn off the whole thing to turn the lights off. You can turn on the diffuser without lights but once on I can only get them off by turning off the diffuser. It lasts almost through the night maybe 6 hours? I find taking off the ceramic cover easier than covers of other diffusers. I use this for just my bedroom so it is perfect. I did not come with a measuring cup for water, this is unusual but I had an extra so no big deal.",3
"I'm disappointed. Mostly in myself as I should have read the ingredient list carefully. This is just a glycerin soap with chemicals and a negligent amount of honey and lots of heavy perfume. It's a bit drying for my face. I will probably finish this as a hand soap.<br />I'm going to continue to look for a better, more natural honey soap.",2
"I have difficulty with serums as they tend to cause breakouts. Happily, this one did not. Maybe because there is almond oil in it, my skin does very well with that. I haven't noticed a reduction in wrinkles but this is gentle enough to use around my eyes. This makes my skin smoother for applying makeup in the morning and the serum isn't greasy at all.<br />I really like that this isn't tested on animals and I think the price is decent. Time will tell if this makes me look younger.",4
"I have always loved this oil but I haven't used it in years, I thought it had been discontinued. I was given a bottle of the lightly scented version to review. I can be sensitive to some scented products, they can give me headaches. This one is light enough to not bother me at all. Because the weather has been so warm, I add peppermint oil when I use this. It is refreshing and cooling. I am a big fan of using oils to moisturize my skin, though than can be greasy. What I like about this oil is that it absorbs quickly so I can get dressed right away if need be. I usually just towel off to slightly damp skin then use this oil and air dry. It really makes my skin soft and smooth. I'm glad this oil is still around. When I run out, I will definitely buy more.",5
The perfect addition to your day time routine. N3 No Name can serve as a perfect and easy to apply primer. The scent is light and pleasant. The finish is fresh and smooth.,5
"The Multivitamin Sleeping Mask by Vitamasques is made in Korea. The tube has a foil safety seal under the cap.<br /><br />I liked the concept of a face mask I could wear to bed. I’m not as good as I should be at keeping to a proper skincare routine. So I thought this sleeping mask would be great. Put it on before bed and wake up with a hydrated, healthier face.<br /><br />The directions say “Apply a generous layer before you sleep or whenever your skin needs a nourishing boost.” I started with a small pea-sized drop, which was enough for my whole face.<br /><br />The mask has a gel consistency and goes on clear. But it did not absorb into my skin. After fifteen minutes, my face was still sticky and tacky. No way would I go to sleep like that, my face would stick to the pillow.<br /><br />So I washed the mask off, which was a disappointment since it’s supposed to be a “non-wash off mask.” My skin was a little softer, but having to wash my face because it was still sticky defeats the purpose of a mask that I’m supposed to be able to wear to sleep.",2
"This jelly facial cleanser from Vitamasques is made in Korea.<br /><br />The tube has a foil safety seal under the white cap. The cleanser is brown with a jelly-like consistency. It does have a scent, a mix of green tea and tea tree oil. I do notice the scent when using the cleanser but the scent doesn’t linger.<br /><br />A small drop is enough to wash my face and neck. It doesn’t make a lot of lather but does feel silky going on the skin. I really like the consistency of it.<br /><br />And I really like how well the cleanser works! It cleaned two layers of sunscreen grime and sweat off my face. Some face washes don’t remove all the sunscreen residue, and I have to keep washing my face or use an exfoliating scrub. This cleanser? One wash and done. I was amazed by how well it worked.<br /><br />I’m in my 30s, white, with sensitive combination skin. The cleanser did not irritate my face at all.",5
"If I have a choice between a plain headband and a unicorn headband, well, I’m picking the unicorn headband every time!<br /><br />These headbands are super cute and colorful. The faux fur is soft and doesn’t shed, and really adds to the unicorn aspect. The horns stand up from the headband, and are sparkly silver. The ears don’t stand up as well, they’re a bit floppy, and also have sparkly silver on the backs.<br /><br />The headbands are on the smaller side. I measured approximately 6 inches across the opening with a headband unstretched, and about 9 inches when fully stretched. I like that the headbands are tight, they stay on my head and hold my hair back. I don’t have to keep fussing with them, they stay in place. They are about 2½ inches wide, which helps with comfort.",5
"I like one side of this Silicone Back Scrubber from Lnlofen. The “soft brush” side, the one with the longer bristles, works great for scrubbing my back. I can actually feel the bristles move against my skin, and so I feel like I’m getting clean.<br /><br />The other side, the “stiff brush” side, just slid right over my skin. I didn’t feel the bumps at all.<br /><br />I’m 5’5” and slender, the back scrubber is long enough for me.<br /><br />The package includes a hook to hang the brush in the shower, but I just loop it over the shower rail and it dries quickly. The brush can roll up into a compact bundle for storage.",4
"This pack of 16 nail files from Keiby Citom is a great value.<br /><br />I started doing dip nails at home, and the worst part is getting off the old manicure. I have to file off the layers of top coat, which can take a while if I don’t have a good file. I prefer a glass file for actually shaping my nails, but they’re not good for removing layers of polish.<br /><br />Using one of these files, I had the top coat filed off all my nails in less than ten minutes. The 100 grit side is perfect. I actually asked a nail tech friend what I should use, and she told me 100 grit.<br /><br />The files come in a zipper seal plastic bag that can be used to store them.<br /><br />The edges of the files aren’t sharp. I’m talking about the edges that touch your skin; sometimes these can be sharp, especially on pro files, and need to be seasoned to prevent cuts. No problems with that here.",5
"The look of the Lassie hair dryer is what caught my eye first. It just looks cool! I have the PinkGray color. The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won’t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn’t move easily, so there’s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn’t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I’ve used. But I like that I can set the temperature to cool to lessen damage and not have to hold in a cool shot button.<br /><br />The hair dryer isn’t as lightweight as some plastic models I’ve used, but it’s weighted pretty well. The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there’s less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.",4
"I tried the Cedarwood Essential Oil from Sweetvally. The oil is so strong that I smelled it even before removing it from the box or breaking the seal on the bottle. The bottle is tiny but mighty, I guess!<br /><br />The oil almost pours out from the bottle, so be careful when adding this to a diffuser or anything else. I accidentally added too much to my diffuser the first time I tried it, because the oil dripped out so quickly.<br /><br />The cedarwood scent is very woodsy. I personally find the scent calming. I read it can also help keep insects away.<br /><br />The bottle says the extraction method is steam distilled, but does not say where the oil was distilled or anything regarding the country of origin.",4
"This Aloe Vera Gel by Sdara Skincare takes a few minutes to fully absorb into my skin. I worried it would leave behind a sticky feeling, since I could feel it on my arm the whole time it took to dry. But once the gel finally absorbed, I couldn’t feel any residue left behind. I didn’t notice much of any scent either, which is another positive for me.<br /><br />The gel is clear; the plastic bottle is amber colored to help keep light out. I wish the bottle had a flip top or squeeze lid instead of a screw off cap.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is what gives me pause. I’m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice. The product description mentions “we perfected our serum by enriching with Vitamin E, & Citric Acid for improved nutrient absorption.” I don’t see Vitamin E listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I will probably end up using this aloe vera gel to make hand sanitizer. The gel is thick, so it should be good for that use.",3
"The description for this Aloe Vera Gel by CIMIY Skin Care confuses me a little. One of the uses suggested by the manufacturer is to put the gel on before going outside, “which can protect skin from sunburns.” This gel has hyaluronic acid listed as an ingredient, which can actually make skin even more sensitive to UV rays.<br /><br />Aloe Vera is great for soothing sunburns *after* exposure. This gel absorbed into my skin after about a minute, without leaving behind a sticky or tacky feeling. I’ve used some aloe vera gels that have left me a sticky mess, but not this one. So I like the quick absorption.<br /><br />The gel does have a slight scent to it. It’s a fresh-smelling scent that sticks around for a while.<br /><br />This Aloe Vera gel would also be great for homemade hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This gel is manufactured in China.",4
"A friendly word of warning: don’t use Beast Blue Cooling Body Wash down south unless you like tingly body parts.<br /><br />The consistency of the body wash is a little watery, so it’s easy to squeeze out more than you might want. It lathers well and rinses clean without leaving behind a residue.<br /><br />I really like the smell of the body wash. It’s a strong, crisp scent that really does wake you up. My nose tingled the first time I smelled it. The scent is hard to describe. I can’t pick out any individual notes, just a crisp smell that made me go “Wow, this smells cool and different.”",4
"For me, I like the Hand Cleaner and Barrier Cream the most in this bundle. I found that the Superior Healing Hand Cream was just average. These products might seem dude oriented, but they work for anyone.<br /><br />Superior Hand Cleaner with Activated Charcoal (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Works great to remove grease and odors. I like the pumice in the cleanser, as it gives me a real clean, scrubby feeling.<br /><br />Superior Barrier Skin Cream (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Actually does help prevent grease or oil from staining my hands. Also helps keep my fingernails from becoming a dirt mess when I weed without gloves. But doesn’t provide much of a moisturizing effect.<br /><br />Superior Healing Hand Cream (individually 3/5 stars):<br />--Truly unscented hand lotion. But it’s just average as a lotion -- it took a few days of 2-3x per day applications to help heal my cracked hands.",4
"Kale Leaf Extract (Brassica Oleracea Acephala) is the 14th ingredient listed out of 23 for the Cancun Collection Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion. This lotion is made in Canada.<br /><br />The lotion absorbed quickly into my skin, but did leave behind a slightly tacky feel for about 5 minutes after application.<br /><br />It’s currently the middle of winter where I am, so I was able to see just how moisturizing the lotion is for me when I already had dry skin. The lotion has a medium-weight consistency and gets the job done for about half the day.<br /><br />What I don’t like about this lotion is the scent. The scent is subtle, sort of like vanilla coconut, and it’s fine at first. But the scent lingers for several hours, and after that time, I’ve had enough of it.",3
"I spend 99% of my life with chapped lips, so I’m always looking for a chapstick or lip balm that will actually work.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the hemp oil in the Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm. But not all of the ingredients are listed in the product information. I am allergic to beeswax, which is the second ingredient in the lip balm. So I was unable to use it.<br /><br />I’m including a picture of the tube, but for reference, here are the ingredients: helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil, beeswax/cire d’abeille, olea europaea (extra virgin olive) oil, aroma (flavor), cannabis sativa (hemp) seed oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, tocopherol (vitamin E), aloe barbadensis.",3
"If you’ve never used a water flosser before, there’s a definite learning curve. Expect to get wet the first few times, if not more. The learning curve and mess is worth it -- my mouth generally feels cleaner after using one -- but I don’t love this particular model.<br /><br />I wanted a water flosser that wouldn’t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter. This one is a sort of all-in-one, with the reservoir built into the handle, but I kept getting water bubbles in the tank/tip, which made flossing take a lot longer.<br /><br />There’s only 3 speeds: low, medium, and high. The low is quite low. And because of where the speed switch button is, it’s really easy to accidentally switch speeds while using the flosser.<br /><br />The flosser charges via USB, but with a proprietary end (not A or C or anything like that).",3
Super hydrating and goes on like silk. Convenient and easy to use pump bottle. A little goes a long way.,5
I use these as a toner after I wash my face and before I apply any serums or moisturizer. They work great to help tighten my pores and pick up anything my face wash missed. Usually I skip using any sort of included tweezers but these pads are a bit thinner and using the tweezers makes it much easier to get just one.,5
Overly rose scented and it upset my scalp. Left it red and flaky.,2
"Soaks in well, didn't irritate my skin. Helps perk my skin up in the morning. Well packaged, pump works great.",5
This is a great all in one serum that hits all my main wants. It is a bit oily though so be careful how much you use. I tend to use this one more at night so I don't have to worry about waiting for it to fully absorb before adding moisturizer.,5
"Smells great and didn't upset kiddos skin like some of the stronger scented lotions we have do. A bit pricey for body lotion and I'm dreading trying to get the bottom of the product out, otherwise it is quality stuff.",5
"I like the texture and application of this moisturizer. It soaks in well and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. However, it is way over scented for my preference. The scent is nice, but just too strong and doesn't fade for quite awhile.",4
"This didn't absorb well at all. It sat on the surface of my skin forming a shiny barrier nothing else could get through. I tried it a few times using less and less, thinking that I was just putting too much on. Nothing helped. I had better luck using it overnight as a deep hydrator. But it didn't play nice with my face cream, and prevented it from soaking in. In the morning my skin felt heavy and it was oily enough that my hair ended up greasy in the front from touching my forehead while I slept.",3
"These are about the strength I need. My feed are usually pretty calluse free but come summer they get a bit beat up. I have used the more expensive well known brand and it was almost too effective and left my feet tender.<br /><br />If you just need a bit of a touch up these are great, if you want the full she-bang of peeling layers and layers, get the $20 a pair brand.",5
"I was happy with how well this absorbed, I've tried a few other vitamin C serums and its a mixed bag. About half leave my skin sticky and don't seem to absorb. Sia's however was great. Soaked in and didn't feel like it was sitting on top of my skin.<br /><br />Super easy to layer with other products.",5
"It is a pretty small bottle for $25 body lotion. Also, a little does NOT go a long way with this one and I had to use more than I typically do. Overall, I would say it was decently moisturizing but not amazingly so and certainly not enough to merit the price.<br /><br />As for the smell, it was just odd, like slightly organic but not strong. Just off-putting. Faded quickly though.",3
"I was a bit skeptical before trying because I find most hair masks to be more hype than anything else. This one however was great for my long thick wavy mess of a head of hair. It left my hair soft, manageable, and even a bit shinier than before. My hair felt hydrated without being weighted down, and wasn't left straw like which has happened to me in the past when I try to deep condition. I can usually go about 3-4 days between shampoos and didn't find myself needing to wash my hair any sooner than that. Obviously, if you shampoo more often on the regular you will have a different result than me. But basically it didn't leave my hair feeling dirty the next day.<br /><br />My process: I shampooed and then like most masks and conditioners I kept it away from my roots and only applied it from the midshaft to my ends (otherwise I end up with oily roots). Then I waited... and waited... and waited. Since I was reviewing the product I wanted to make sure I waited the full 10 mins to give it a chance. I was out of stuff to wash and shave after about 3 min so the last 7 were pretty boring. In the future I will probably only wait 5 min. I didn't apply any other conditioner other than my normal heat protector I spritz onto towel dried hair. Blow-dried as usual and the results let me skip the flat iron.<br /><br />I was pretty please. I find this an easy mask to recommend. I have spent much more and gotten less of a result. I also like that it didn't leave my hair smelling perfumy afterwards.",5
"This one seemed a bit gentler than the others I've tried in the past. If you have sensitive skin, then this would be a good alternative. It was still effective just not as ""intense"".",5
These absorbed well and don't leave your hands greasy. They smell light and fresh and everyone in the house enjoyed the scent.,5
"I was hoping there would be a price available at the time of this review, but currently it wasn't posted. Bath bombs come in a range of prices and quality, without a price it's hard to say if this is a good value. Kiddo loves bath bombs, but he values toys and water coloring over quality of skin softening or scent. So for this set he was not of any help. I tried one and found it to be nice but not as skin softening as some of the bigger ones I've tried. These are really more midline as the fizz is just average, scent was alright and not off putting but not amazing.<br /><br />If these are under $15 I'd say great value, above $20 and I'm not sure they are worth it, but not a terrible deal.",4
"When I first got these I was like what kinda 80s looking crazy huge thing did I get. Then I put one in my thick med/long hair and was impressed. No pulling, hold well and didn't slip out. Plus, the size means they really do fit comfortably around your wrist.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",5
I was pleasantly surprised by this set. The white of course took an extra coat to not look streaky but other than that they performed pretty well. Not the longest lasting by themselves but paired with my normal base and top coat they were about the same wear as some of my more expensive bottles from Opi and ILNP.,5
Not a fan of these. They have very little swab so are hard and not padded well. The stick breaks easily and then its sharp. I can't recommend.,2
"Shampoo is great, the conditioner is okay, and the vitamins didn't really do anything. Hubby doesn't really need a great conditioner though since his hair is pretty short so we weren't to concerned about that. I tried the conditioner just to see and wasn't a fan. I have frizzy tangle prone hair and this just wasn't moisturizing enough. But I also usually buy conditioner specific to my hair type so I can't fault this one too much for not being it.",4
"I ended up really liking these. I was a teen in the 90s and loved my scrunchies, so happy to see them making a comeback. These worked well in my thick hair, although the satin ones do loosen up a bit but only because the material is slippery.  You can wear all day without getting that annoying hair pulled headache feeling.<br /><br />I think my favorite are the middle ones, that have a small tail, they look super cute.  They and the long ones are more of a scarf material. I've liked the whole set. Great for the price too.",5
"Kiddo liked this, but probably because of the kid friendly scent. He isn't prone to burning so I had to try it as well, and it kept my very fair skin from getting red even after I got drenched from the hose repeatedly. I prefer a lotion feel than the gel, but he didn't mind the consistency. All and all it did what it was suppose to.",5
"I tried a couple other charcoal peel off masks before this that were MUCH much easier to use, both a bit more expensive but neither crazy so. Luckily I had no issues with the bottle splitting like some others reported. Here is what I did not like about the product.<br /><br />Issue #1: This one didn't peel off in nice big patches more like you had to chip away at it which was messy time consuming and harsher on my face than it needed to be.<br /><br />Issue#2: It also was ineffective, it didn't unclog anything. At most it removed a top layer of dead skin making my skin feel softer (and dryer), but after rechecking my pores with a magnifying mirror (if you want to hate yourself buy one and then freak out at your skin, lol) there was no real difference. The before and after of my pores under the mirror were nearly identical.<br /><br />So all that work and annoyed skin for nothing. Mostly though I was just aggravated that it came apart in a million little shreds rather than actually just peel off my skin. That's the best part, booooo.",2
"This thing was great and worked as well as my Diva Darling microfiber hair towel. I'm not sure I'd call any of the microfiber towels rapid drying but they do pull out more moisture and create less frizz than a standard bath towel. I have super thick wavy (coughFrizzycough) hair that is just past my shoulders, and I had plenty of room to spare with this towel. It could easily work for even longer thicker hair.<br /><br />It wrapped so easily and really stayed put with the little elastic band in the back. My other is a standard towel so you have to twist and tuck and hope it stays. Not with these, super secure. Plus, there is 4 of them so I never have to time laundry and shower again.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",5

I love the side pieces on these clip in bangs extension. They make it so much easier to blend with your natural hair. I don’t have enough hair for bangs so this was the perfect solution.,5
This Stride Foot Cream comes in a little tub. It’s quite thick and felt a touch touch greasy going on. It instantly softened my feet and smoothed my dry skin. It absorbs fairly quickly. I just don’t think I would pay $27 for such a small tub of it.,4
After extensive patch testing I discovered that this eye corrector serum works great on my sensitive skin! I love the pump. It goes on smooth and smells amazing. I haven’t noticed a difference in my eye puffiness but I think it helps my dark circles and it’s nice and moisturizing.,5
I love these lashes and have already went in for seconds,5
"It's not the best I've ever used, but at the price point it's good. The main thing is to be careful not to use too much at first as it takes very little. That took some adjusting to. I might stick with this one for a while. It's pretty good.",4
"The smell is overwhelming, the worst I've ever encountered in a hair dye. I'd suggest keeping the windows open and use a fan.<br /><br />It's easy to use, pretty much the same instructions as any other hair dye I've tried. For best results, it's important to do the allergy and stand tests as instructed.  Also follow the instructions about not massaging It into the scalp. It burns a little if that happens.<br /><br />It covers grey well. It lightened dark blond hair somewhat, and produced an uneven time, which is part of the point, but which seemed a little erratic for my taste.",3
Works well on my tail bone length hair.  I use it to comb my hair after a shower when it is wet.  Great for massaging the scalp too.  Attractive.  Sturdy.  No complaints or regrets.,5
"I am familiar with the Kopari brand.  They are considered a ""clean beauty"" brand with less toxins than most.  This is a fun little set.  Not overly sticky.  Imparts a nice shine and makes lips feel good.  Non drying.  These would make a great gift.  No complaints or regrets.",5
"Did not make a difference on my middle-aged, normal to dry skin.  Applied well.  Not sticky, but did not make skin soft or have any noticeable changes.  First ampoule shattered in my hand.  Small pieces of glass everywhere and then I was afraid of rubbing tiny fragments of glass into my face.  Instructions are also not good on how to open them properly.  Not super impressed and I normally like many Babor products.",3
"Chose this to replace an older one my husband had that got left outside too long.  This is excellent on horses and also goats, both of which we have.  Horses seem to like being brushed this way.  Actually works well on cats and dogs too, but it is a little rougher and sometimes scares them.  My little cat though loved the gloves though.  The groomer is well made.  As good of quality as the other name brand one we had.  No complaints or regrets on this set.",5
"Surprisingly like this.  ""Romance"" ends up being a more neutral and not an in your face color.  I have light to medium cool undertoned skin.  Goes on shimmery purple, wipes off to a pinky / coraly / red. Stays all day.  I usually use it under other lipstick so when the lipstick fades there is still color there.  I have sensitivities to chemical and toxins and this does not seem to bother me that I immediately see.  Overall ... no regrets.  Better than expected.",5
Good sharp scissors.  Have not seen any rusting on these.  Feel good in my hands.  Cut well.  Good quality hair cutting scissors.  No regrets.,5
"[[VIDEOID:5c532f5f5d94b55721fdf6748ddcc641]] I want you to try these for two reasons, first of all because I often make my own DIY cosmetics, including lip balms and glosses. These applicators are perfect to use with those.<br />Also, have you ever found that perfect shade of lipstick that you can't live without, only to find that it's been discontinued? These applicators help get every last bit of lipstick out of a tube so that you can enjoy it longer.<br />As you can see, the colors are pretty bright. I think that these would look more upscale in more muted colors, and if that's what you're going for, I would suggest getting the other color option in these. To be honest, what I would prefer, is if they were paper or wood instead of plastic. A little more environmentally friendly.<br />Still, they're good for what they are. The doe-foot tip Is slanted, just like with your favorite tubed liquid lip products. They are fuzzy, so they hold the lip product.<br />Makeup artists, as well as their clientele, will appreciate that these can be used once and then tossed. No spreading of germs and bacteria.",4
"Not only are these sheets good for do-it-yourself masks, but they're fabulous at making any good serum a high-end mask.<br />What I like to do is open one of the individual packets and pull out the tablet, which is a compressed mask. And then, I take very hot water in order to get it to open up. After cleansing my face, I will load it with serum, and then put the warm mask over my face. It's easy to pat it into your skin to make it stay.<br />Lean back and relax, I generally do it for half an hour.<br />Remove the mask and gently massage the remaining serum into your face, and continue with your facial routine of moisturizer, sunscreen, whatever you use next.<br />So, whether you dip them in pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, or whatever your DIY routine is, or you use a prepared serum from your favorite brand, these are convenient, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive.<br />I especially like the individual packaging because they stay sanitary. I can pop a couple of them in my makeup bag and always be ready to go on any adventure that requires an overnight stay.<br />Thanks for reading.",5
"Definitely a clean fragrance that's fine for anyone.<br />To me, the scent is pettigrain, orange blossoms.<br />As you would expect, it doesn't have a lot of longevity. But after application it's quite uplifting. Not overpowering.<br />Absolutely suitable for babies and toddlers, as well as teens and moms.",5
"From pin-up girls to starlets, from old Hollywood movie queen royalty to the girls at the automat, certain red lipsticks have dominated makeup counters for decades.<br />This is one of them.<br /><br />Everything about this lipstick, except for the modern wearability, is vintage glamour. The shape of the tube and the shape of the lipstick itself harkens to another era. Perfect for making the ultimate Cupid's bow pout. It even has that slight fragrance that will remind you of vintage lipsticks.<br /><br />I normally wear red that has a little more blue in it, so was surprised that this clear red was fine for me. To me that says that it will flatter a wide range of skin tones.<br />After swiping it on my wrist and then wiping it away, it left a nice stain. If you aren't interested in that drop dead gorgeous look and want something a little more subtle, it does double duty by leaving a pinky red stain when blotted. But go for the high voltage dramatic red if you want to be noticed.<br /><br />Very comfortable lipstick, but I didn't have a problem with it bleeding. Non-drying and non-cracking. Opaque coverage with one swipe.<br />Another plus, it makes your teeth look super white.<br />I hope that this review as well as the photographs can help you to make a decision about this lipstick. It's really hard buying such things online, especially when it comes to luxury brands like this.",5
"If you don't want to think about having to touch up your liner all day, and I mean ALL day, you'll love this clever eyeliner.<br />Dual tips means you have one product that gives you 100% precision.<br />If you like to get artistic, if you like to play with your makeup, those tips are so much fun and you can create so many looks. From slim cat eye to thick Cleopatra.<br />Very nice, definitely a keeper.",5
"I got these because they have aloe vera.  I have sensitive skin and these do a nice job of gentle cleaning, low odor with no ill effects.  They are also nice and portable as I can put them in my bag when I travel.",5
"As a big fan of hair masks, this is one of the better ones that I've used.<br />I have fine and fragile hair, that is thinning due to heredity and age. This mask smooths it down and makes it look to be in better condition.<br />Even the ends don't look as fly away.<br />If you have hair with issues, this is a good product to try.",5
"After taking this wig out and giving it a good shake, the cut on this is fantastic! It's the super trendy wolf cut.<br />The color is fun, but I have no problem wearing this wig out and about.",5
"The built-in brush makes this product easy to apply. If you need to put your makeup on in a hurry, this stuff is really great.<br />You can control how much comes out onto the brush and then use the brush to apply it evenly. It works as well as most primers in that it hides some of the medium, if not the large, pores.<br />Easy to tuck in your makeup bag.",5
This review is for the large size. The size is something you might want to consider if you have thin or fine hair. Just know what you're getting.<br /><br />They hold well and are super cute.,5
"These are wonderful for freshening up face and hands. On the box, it's suggests that you can wipe down surfaces. They aren't antibacterial, and they don't clean, but they will leave a nice refreshing scent. On many surfaces, they will leave streaks, as well as not really cleaning.<br />I suggest using them mainly as a quick way to clean your hands on the go without alcohol or chemicals that you might not want on your skin.",4
"Perhaps it's just me, but I found this product to be very artificial looking. Nothing natural about it including the color.<br />Please keep in mind that it might be just the right color for you, but this didn't make my salt and pepper brows look any better.",3
"It's probably happened to just about every busty woman.<br />You're wearing a top, and are justn't even particularly revealing but it might be a little loose. You bend down, and when you look up you notice somebody's eyes popping out of their head because you've showed more than a little cleavage when you bent down. Especially if you weren't wearing a bra!<br />This helps not only to keep those situations in check, but it also helps when a button is at the wrong area and creates a gap.<br />Not just for movie stars wearing super revealing fashions!",5
"This set is good because these types of tools wear out quickly. It doesn't make sense to spend a lot of money on them because you're going to have to replace them frequently.<br />If it's a really cold night, unbelievably, a horse can get an undercoat just that quick. The gloves are important to get that undercoat in check, all year long.",5
"I actually hadn't intended on doing a before and after photograph, but there was such a difference after I massaged this lotion into my hands, that I wanted to show you how much of a difference it made. With just one application.<br />Now I understand why this is used at hospitals. It is amazingly effective as well as being allergen-free. Steroid free. Fragrance free. There's a little bit of a natural aroma of the ingredients but it is not offensive. It smells like just about every other fragrance-free product The big difference is that this one is way more effective than most other products of this type that I've tried. This is one that makes me wish I had given the others lower ratings. It's that good.<br />Not high priced. No splashy logos. Just an extremely effective lotion for extremely dry skin.",5
"Although this is a pretty cheaply made set, it actually does the job reasonably well. Not just for puppies. I have a standard poodle that has a curly coat that is cropped for the summer. It works very well on his tight curls.",4
"For some reason, it's hard to find extensions in this color. It seems that anything with a mixed gray isn't very popular, or at least not popular enough to mass produce.<br />That's a shame because it's gorgeous. Not only if you have gray hair, but if you want a really interesting contrast color.<br />Clip-ins are easy to use if you are a novice.",5
"This goes on dark, but doesn't deposit enough color for me. If you like just a subtle look, it's fine. I confess that I use it without rinsing it out because otherwise the color isn't enough for me.",4
"You can't beat these for adding some volume and thickness. There's a bit of a learning curve but thankfully there are plenty of YouTube videos out there to help you with installation, even if you're doing it by yourself. It helps to have two mirrors so that you can see the back of your head.<br />Very pretty and a good value.",5
"I love the chocolate and chestnut colors of this silky wig.<br />When you first remove it from the netting, there's a lot of static so you do need to spray it down before wearing it. It's one of the better scalps on wigs of this price range, as you can see in the photograph. Not as fake looking as most.<br />In my opinion it's a very good wig for the money.",5
"This is a Place on, Pat on mask.<br />You remove the mask and carefully place it on your face and smooth it down, and leave it on for about half an hour. While it's on it feels just delightful. It contains hyaluronic acid on a biocellulose sheet that clings to your face. It's as if you can feel all that good stuff soaking into your skin. Also contains ceramides, another skin-loving component.<br />After removal there's no need to rinse. You simply pat any remaining solution into your skin.<br />A great way to pamper yourself as well as nourish your face.",5
"Although I had to trim the bangs a little bit as they were too long, this is a very pretty wig that has natural gray coloring.<br />The hair itself is soft. Other than trimming the bangs, it's ready to wear right out of the package.",5
"Packaged perfectly for gift-giving, these hand lotion tubes are not the most hydrating when it is compared to long-lasting healing creams, but the light fragrance is delightful.<br />And don't get me wrong, these will leave your hands soft and moisturized. I just found I had to reapply a few times throughout the day to get the hydration I like.",5
"Definitely not for the professional, or for precise work at home, but good enough for little touch-ups.<br />The price reflects the quality, or vice versa, so it still gets four stars. If the price were higher, it would be different.<br />The tip of the cutting scissors is not to a point, but the blunt isn't filed down either. So these are going to need the same amount of care that you don't poke someone's eye out as you would with a needle point scissors. Kind of defeats the purpose of them having been blunted.<br />Comfortable enough for my average size female hands, and a nice feature is the rubber nub that keeps it from clacking together as you close the scissors.",4
"Decent enough but wish they were sharper, especially at the ends. I use the ends of the snipper to do hang nails and trim the corners of the fingernail itself. Granted I use them for more than cuticles, which wears them out faster, but when I think of the name Soligen I expect a product of superior quality.",4
"Clip-ins are so convenient. And I find that they're one of the easiest types of extensions if you're doing it yourself, without anyone else to help you.<br />For the money, you'd be hard pressed to find better extensions. The hair is very nice, the color is stunning.<br />The clips are nice and sturdy, I expect no problems with them in the future.<br />It's important to remember to wash them carefully. Dip in water that has a little mild shampoo, and gently squeeze. Carefully lift up and place in fresh water.",5
"Highly fragranced set, beautifully hand packed with tissue.<br />You can order this with confidence if you are giving it as a gift, because an outer cardboard box protects the gift box itself from any shipping damage.<br />Just opening it up is a delight. The aroma is soothing with natural fragrance. Not a hint of off chemical odors, just fresh essential oils, blended for a peaceful experience.<br />I especially like the petite candle that is a lovely way to complete the experience. You can have a candle lit bath using the bath gel, and spray the linens with the pillow spray for a calming and sleep inducing experience.<br /><br />Very caring gift for someone facing challenges and stress",5
"Love the way this balm and conditioner is fragranced. If you like oud, with it's mysteriously sensual scent of woodsy incense, this is for you.<br />The jar looks uniquely elegant.<br />Although it's a solid balm, it melts easily in your hands. In shipping, it looks like it seperated a bit, right down to staining the presentation box.<br />While that might be an issue if giving as a gift, it does not affect the quality or use.<br />A little goes a long way, and that amazing scent stays on a good while.",4
"These little tubes of hand cream make wonderful gifts because they are packaged each in a special little box. Great stockers or just a little token of appreciation.<br />This review is for the olive variety.<br />I didn't find it to be the most moisturizing hand cream that I've tried but it isn't too bad. Considering that it's so giftable, I feel that it's definitely worth the money. You can always try one before you give away the others.<br />Very light fragrance suitable for just about anyone.",4
"I'm so glad but finally the United States is getting access to some of the top skincare in the world that originates in Korea.<br />As the listing states, these are gentle exfoliating pads that peel away and dissolve microscopic dead skin gradually and gently. Within a week you can see brighter healthier skin that was hiding under the surface.<br />And it does it all without irritation!<br />As with any acidic facial care product, it's important to remember sunscreen if you go out.",5
"I found this mask to be quite comfortable as well as easy to breathe through. Suitable for any gender, and it's even a little stylish with an on-trend color as well as a very helpful strap. Now when I choose to take it off, I can have it hanging around my neck, ready to pull it back up if necessary. The ear loops are adjustable with a little bead that by now most of us are familiar with using.<br />It claims to be antimicrobial because of some copper content. It's also quick drying as well as offering UV protection.<br />Made in Korea.",5
"This line uses the well-researched benefits of olive in order to create a skin care that rejuvenates and heals. This particular product is great for morning puffy eyes. I keep it in a cosmetics cooler in the bathroom so that it's colder than room temperature when I pat it on.<br />Makes you look bright eyed and ready for the day, even if you had a rough night.",5
"I like these so much that I purchased more.<br />This German skin care line is one of my favorites because of the quality of ingredients and the effectiveness of the product.<br />No irritation, even around my sensitive eyes.<br />The serum preps your skin for the next step of skin care, such as moisturizer. Your day or night cream sinks into your skin better, creating a noticeable difference in fine lines.",5
"Harnessing the power of olive, these are wonderfully skin soothing drops. Not only do they moisturize, but they seem to heal minor irritations such as the little red spots that I get.<br />Expensive, but definitely worth it, especially on little imperfections that you wish would heal faster",5
"You can pay a pretty penny for a skin care product that has a percentage of squalane in it, but this is 100% squalane.<br />I really like that this is plant based, as opposed to being derived from sharks, after all the result is the same.<br />A few drops and parched skin is instantly soft with just a touch of  glow. Or you can mix it with any other skincare product or even a foundation, in order to make it more hydrating.<br />No fragrance whatsoever, so scent sensitive people will love this.<br />Another thing to appreciate is that the bottle and dropper are both glass.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />On its own or as an additive in a DIY creation, this may be clear, but it's liquid gold.",5
"It really IS like a mild Botox treatment!<br />Ummm, I may or may not know that from personal experience, haha!<br />Okay, yes, I know it from personal experience.<br />As a little background, paracress has been long used as an anti-inflammatory and numbing herb, it's even called the toothache herb.<br />It also 'numbs', as in relaxes, the skin.<br />Guess what, that's exactly how Botox works.<br />While it isn't going to have nearly the same dramatic effect, I found it to be enough of the difference to where this is always going to be in my makeup/skincare bag.<br />Clinical trials using it in this way have indicated that it works on all but about 25% of the participants, so there's a chance it might not work for you. I'm thrilled to be in the percent that it did.<br />It has some of the same chemical components as Szechuan pepper, which has got to be safer than the botulism in Botox, right?<br /><br />Paracress is almost unheard of outside of Brazil. This will be our little secret!<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s. I've always taken care of my skin and stayed out of the sun, so I probably have fewer wrinkles than most people my age, but trust me, I've got them.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will help you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to make the rather substantial investments in this product. It's definitely a risk since it doesn't work for everyone. And I can't stress enough that it's not going to be super dramatic change. But heck, I'm excited at even small changes.<br /><br />xxoo",5
"Although I'm not thrilled that this didn't have a safety seal on it, the cream itself is very good. It's a heavy cream, despite the company identifying it as being light and whipped. It looks whipped in the jar, but it is not light on the face. I don't think it would be suitable for all ages. Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true. Even in this dry area, my face feels hydrated all day when I use this cream.<br />It contains milk protein, yogurt extract, blueberry extract, rice protein, and a host of other skin-loving ingredients.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to invest in this product. It is indeed generously sized at 3.4 oz, and it has a very high quality ingredients. But like I said, it's not going to be for everyone.<br /><br />xxoo",5
"Do you like champagne cocktails? This one smells like a combination of peach and champagne, and even looks like it!<br />It comes out like a gel. It's activated by water, so after washing your face, leave your face damp and put a thin layer of the gel quickly all over your face. Include your neck if you like.<br />Then with each passing moment, it's going to get foamier and foamier. That's why you have to have a very thin coat. You only need a small amount of product. If you use too much, your face is going to foam up like you have shaving cream all over!<br /><br />After about 5 or 10 minutes, you massage a little bit with warm water and then rinse. After you dry your face it's going to feel squeaky clean. If you have dry skin, you're ready for a moisturizing serum and cream. If you have oily or acne prone skin, use the appropriate products for that skin type. I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br />This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues. Because I have sensitive skin that can be triggered, but I only left it on for about 4 minutes. I had absolutely no irritation, but I think if I had left it on longer, I might have. That doesn't mean it's bad for you. If you leave a mild castile soap, which is so gentle, on your face for any length of time, skin will be irritated.<br />Made in the USA, from Tonica Skin in Marblehead Massachusetts.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to try this fun mask. It really does leave your skin feeling and looking energized, but it's a bit of an investment. Nice splurge for a spa night, and because the product comes out via a pump, it's going to be sanitary for all the participants.<br />It's going to make for some really fun and Instagram worthy photos!<br /><br />xxoo<br /><br />PS, my 'spa night' pal doesn't look too impressed 😆",5
"Having never used a micro-needle patch before, but often using a derm roller, I expected some discomfort, but that wasn't the case.<br />Although there was not a huge difference, there was indeed a difference.<br />When you stop using them, you will be back at square one, but there is definitely a softening of lines for about a week after the treatments.",4
"This is pure genius.<br />After unscrewing the top of the cap, you'll see the film that protects the batteries. After you remove it, put the top back on and separate the light unit from the jar.<br />The red LED light will be activated by pressing against your skin. Does that light actually do anything, or is it a gimmick?<br />There are a number of high-priced red light units on the market. They were first used in dermatologist offices and med spas. When they first came out, I had a red Tanda unit. This is exactly the same concept, and yes, you will have a slight difference.<br />The amount of cream gone in the jar has been for about 10 applications. I do it at night so I can relax while holding the unit at various places on my face. The red light goes on when you press slightly on the metal ring, as you can see in the photographs. As you press it to the area of your face that you want treated, slide it from the middle of your face outward, for 3 minutes. Then go to the next area. This way you get a little bit of a lymphatic massage. If you suffer with sinus headaches, this action is very good at offering some relief.<br /> The cream is very lightly fragranced with a fresh scent. It's a gel or mousse type of cream.<br />After purchasing this, you can get the cream refill.<br /><br />So much cheaper than buying an LED light device like a Tanda.",5
"I'm a sucker for beautiful packaging.<br />Here we have a gorgeous tea canister that is well made and beautiful. It also closes tightly, keeping my tea fresh. A good tea canister is not cheap, so I didn't have sticker shock with this product.<br /><br />Thankfully, the company thoughtfully puts out refill packs of this delicious and calming tea.<br />I'll definitely be ordering a refill because not only do I like it myself, but after going through so many different calming and sleep inducing teas, this is my spouse's absolute favorite. Not just because of the taste, but it helps her to totally relax and even sleep throughout the night. Other teas and sleep formulations such as melatonin and valerian supplements just don't do the trick.<br />For me, it's more about the delightful taste. Slightly floral, slightly sweet. Yes, it does relax me and is helpful as part of a nighttime ritual, but not as much as my spouse. We both love it but for different reasons.<br /><br />And I just adore the look of the canister. A lovely gloss ceramic, with an Art Deco nod, that fits in any decor. No hiding it, it's proudly on the counter, ready for anytime you need a little tea comfort.",5
"This brand of mask is not off the chart expensive, but it's always helpful to try things out before making the big investment.<br />What a terrific way to try the various masks that this company offers! The quad pack includes skin resurrection for rejuvenating, chillax for calming, magic mushroom for moisturizing, and glow and go for brightening.<br />Perfect for a pajama parties with a spa theme!<br />The ingredients are similar in all of them. They all contain skin-loving aloe vera as well as cucumber extract, and even manuka honey. And all of them are pleasantly scented and very refreshing to use.",5
"When skin is stressed, every little thing bothers it. Too much heat, too much cold, too much wind, too much dry air.<br />Those of us with sensitive skin know exactly what stressed out skin is. We need something that will soothe, without any irritation.<br />This particular cream hit that goal for me. I used it during a rosacea flare up, to help the redness and discomfort calm down. It worked very well. Not a miracle, but it worked well.<br />If you have skin like mine, I hope it works for you.",5
"I wanted this oil because it's a blend that contains both lavender and patchouli. I absolutely adore patchouli, although some products that contain it don't have that wonderful incense sent.<br />This blend is delightful. You get the patchouli and spicy lavender mixed with a little bit of citrus as well as yang yang. There is even a touch of nutmeg to add even more warm spice.<br />I also love the elegant dropper, so much nicer than a rubber dropper. The gold top has a button that depresses to dispense a drop at a time.<br />A very special oil. You don't need a carrier because it's already in skin-loving avocado oil.<br />It has a shrink wrap to protect against contamination, as well as to assure that you've gotten a brand new product. Very important to me.<br />Oils can go rancid quickly, and this manufacturer puts an expiration date on the bottom. Any product that can go rancid should have that, but not all do, so that's another great thing about this oil.",5
"Anything that helps during these stressful times, even a little, is important.<br />This has a delightfully soothing scent. Perfect blend for a moment of calm.<br />Nice little gift to send to a loved one that is feeling stressed or anxious.",5
"Most wigs in this price range look, well, wiggy.<br />When I'm wearing a colorful or super fun hairstyle in a wig, and people can assume rightly that it's a wig, I have no problem with that. I love wearing wigs that look like wigs.<br />But once in awhile, you just want to blend in with the crowd, and wear a wig that simply looks like you've got great hair.<br />Wigs like that generally cost a heck of a lot more than this one. Was really surprised to see how natural this one looks. In a lot of situations, and by that I mean if it isn't windy or super bright sunshine, no one would think this is a wig. That makes it perfect for shopping, work, and most situations.<br />I find this style to be nearly universally flattering on everyone. It doesn't matter if you have a chubby face or a thin face, this style is classic because most people can wear it.<br />Another thing to like is that this wig doesn't get tangled as long as you keep it on a wig stand.<br />Very good value for a very cute wig.",5
"Feathers can be a little controversial. Rest assured that these are cruelty free! I used to have a peacock as a pet. He shed those beautiful tail feathers every year, and even though he is long gone I still have some of his gorgeous plumes. Peacock feathers are not harvested from the animal, you simply pick them up as they are naturally shed.<br />This set arrived in a plastic bag. When I pulled the pieces out, there were three peacock feather pieces and one headband. Each feather piece has a rhinestone accent at the bottom. One is all rhinestone, one is a pearl surrounded by rhinestones, and one is a London blue stone surrounded by rhinestones.<br />Of the two larger pieces, one has an alligator clip hot glued onto the felt backing, and one has a strip of grossgrain ribbon glued to the back. Although I'm not sure, I suspect that it was at one time glued to the headband, or they leave it to the consumer to glue it to the headband. I tried to push the end of the headband through the middle of the ribbon, thinking that perhaps it could slide on, but it is glued completely, you can't slide it onto the headband.<br />The smaller piece also has an alligator type clip of the same size as the larger clipped piece. They stay beautifully in your hair and are actually comfortable.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this a glamor or fashion accessory set, it's definitely a costume set that would be great for a roaring twenties party. Each one would also be a fun addition to a hat. I wear a lot of hats and love to adorn them with scarves and feathers.<br /><br />The following is not part of my review but it is a kind of funny peacock story. naturally, when guests came over they wanted to see him with his tail spread out in beautiful peacock glory. They only open up like that when they're trying to impress someone, and he certainly was never impressed by any of my guests. At the time I also had a miniature pig. That peacock was so in love with the pig that whenever she came near him he would spread out his feathers and shake them hoping she would notice and return his love. Of course that never happened, the pig could care less. But whenever we wanted to show him off to our friends, we would walk the pig over to him and he would immediately open his tail feathers with a great flourish! My friends and I were all impressed. Maggie the pig was not.",4
"My experience with Middle Eastern perfume has been that they are usually heavily reliant on woods, resins, and incense notes. Very sensual, very provacative.<br />This offering blends in florals and juicy ripe fruits in the dry down.<br />That sounds like it wouldn't work, but it does.<br />The fresh musk gives way to a sexy, feminine aroma.<br />If I were to create a magazine ad for this perfume, it would be a woman with tousled hair, still between the soft bedsheets, satisfied smile on her face. Like I said, provacative.",5
"I love the concept of an individual towelette, not only for convenience, but because I can go from fragrance free to smelling delicious in a heartbeat. Lunch with someone sensitive to perfume and dinner with someone who isn't.<br />That being said, I believe that this delivery system lends itself better to lighter fragrances.<br />On unwrapping the packet, you smell a dark, bitter chocolatey, red wine kind of note. Definitely unique. Usually gourmand fragrances are geared for youth, but this is all grown up and adult.<br />Too intense for warm weather, ok for fall and winter.",5
"I'm in my early 60s, with slight rosacea under my eyes and a couple of red spidery veins around my nose. My spouse is on blood thinners, and bruises easily.<br />The small amount I show on my hand is the amount I need for my rosacea and around my nose. Not very much at all. It did not happen overnight but it did calm the rosacea down, and while they have not all disappeared, the tiniest of the tiny red lines are gone. Gone!<br />This cream has also helped those pesky bruises disappear more quickly.<br /><br />The product contains all of the wonderful herbal and botanical ingredients well-known for healing skin, such as arnica Montana flower, green tea, and chamomile extracts.<br />The flip cap opens easily, just in case you have any hand difficulties and are curious about that. You need to unscrew the flip cap and remove the safety seal, then screw the cap back on. I can't say this enough, I love a product with a safety seal!<br />I even like the packaging. Various plants and flowers on a celadon background.",5
"It's hereditary. Just like my mother, my nose is peppered with large pores. After makeup application, foundation sinks into them making them even more obvious at times.<br />These products work similarly to that very well-known brand that started the whole anti-pore primer craze.<br />They fill in the blanks, so to speak, so that makeup goes on more smoothly.<br />It works well on my nose, and even worked decently on the one pore I nicknamed 'The Pit'.<br /><br />Cute packaging that once again is similar to that popular brand.",5
"These are more environmentally friendly option for facial care. They can be used for cleansing or makeup application.<br />Packaged nicely in an eco-friendly box, so would make a suitable gift. At first I wondered why they included the bag, but of course, no one wants loose sponges tumbling around your washing machine. Simply put them in the bag and when you're ready to do laundry, toss the whole kitten caboodle in the washer. I let them air dry.",5
"These are SO much nicer than the ones in the store.<br />This company really has the size and softness of the towelettes correct.<br />A little bit larger, and they cleanse better, as opposed to simply coating your hands with an antibacterial solution.<br />No irritation or dryness.<br />The first second or so there is a slight stickiness, but when it dries, no stickiness whatsoever.",5
"This review is for the Burgundy Short version of this product, and for reference, my glove size is 7 1/2, or women's large.<br />While it might not be the case for everyone, they included sizes that are a perfect fit. I did not use the smallest, nor the largest nail sizes.<br />The burgundy color is gorgeous.<br />The only filing needed is the very tip.<br /><br />Set does NOT include the adhesive tabs, so remember to have enough on hand.",5
"I like these clips because you have the option of threading a scarf or ribbons through them.<br />I have longer hair, but its very fine.<br />As you can see, even fine hair stays securely up.<br />Nice assortment of designs.<br />The hinges are on the tight side. They appear to be well made but time will tell.<br />The teeth do not bend. Some of the ends of the teeth on some of them have a bit of roughness, as if they need to be filed smooth. Not taking any points away for that, given the low price point.",5
"I often use the Olay water activated cleansing cloths. The problem is you can only use them at home. They are not individually wrapped. You have to take one and put it in a ziplock.<br />These are these individually wrapped, and create the same amount of sudsiness.<br />They are pretty close to being without any scent, but I did detect a faint fragrance reminiscent of cornflower, which does not smell like corn, nor does it smell like a flower. Slightly citrus.<br />They contain willow bark extract, known for soothing inflammation.<br />No stickiness after rinsing. Skin feels clean without being dried out.<br />Definitely keeping one in my handbag for any freshening up emergency.",5
"I love eyelashes. Actually, I love anything girly.<br />These would be terrific for someone that is experimenting with lashes for the first time.<br />The band is slightly thicker than most lashes, and you get quite a few for a low price.<br /><br />Some of the included lashes had some damage. It looks like they were curled under too high of a heat, and they fizzled a bit.<br /> They wouldn't be good enough for going out, but they would be perfect for practice putting on lashes. Application can be daunting for a beginner. Expect to ruin a few pair the first time you try false eyelashes. Use the damaged ones first just to get and idea of how to put them on, and toss them.<br /><br />Disclosure: Product received at a discount in order to test and review.

"We have been using this nozzle for a few weeks, and there are no leaks.<br />That's amusing because we aren't always as careful as we should be when we are finished spraying.<br />It has hit the cement sidewalk more than a few times, without any damage at all.<br />The feature that allows it to  stay on without pressing the lever is quite handy when we top off the pool or are doing a lot of spraying. It saves your hands from getting sore. Multiple settings for water sprays.<br />Nice quality, has a nice heavy feel in your hand.<br /><br />Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. Views and opinions are my own.",5
"I've had a couple of versions of this style of detangling brush.<br />Do they work? YES!<br />Do they last? NO!<br /><br />Except for this one. It has outperformed the others.<br />First, a bit about these brushes. They come in a number of shapes and paddles, but are similar in that they have the same kind of plastic bristles.<br />The bristles stagger in length, and painlessly smooth knots and tangles.<br />Most of the time the bristles start to bend and then the brush is useless. After months of hard use, this one is still good as new.<br /><br />These are a favorite with parents of kids with unruly hair, because they don't hurt.<br />I like it for myself, and it's also my 'secret weapon'.<br /><br />I have 2 Maltese dogs, one is in full coat. That means long, flowing hair to the ground. Most people with a Malt in full coat need to section off the coat and roll up the hair, otherwise it gets so tangled it needs to be cut.<br />This hairbrush is a silky coated dog's best friend. Maltese, Yorkies, Afghans, Havanese...they need this brush!",5
"When I was a little girl, I remember seeing a callus razor of my mothers, and wondered why anyone would use one. Now that I am past the age that she was at that time, I confess I found myself on the hunt for the perfect pedicure items for those of us prone to alligator feet! Forget the ped-egg, it stays sharp for about a minute. Real women use blades! Caution, go lightly the first time, and always on WELL SOAKED tootsies. Less is more, a bit of callus is supposed to on our feet. Turn the double edged blade around for the second foot, then toss it, never use more than once. Buying them like this is the cheapest way to go. These are great quality blades at a great price.",5
"[[VIDEOID:5f071d40944ad845a102d811a0949121]] This is an absolutely amazing value in terms of quantity.<br />Lots of amazing colors that will delight teens and queens and the occasional club kid. Plenty of neutral pans of shadow for more conservative types, lots of great pop colors for the drama types.<br /><br />You will need a good primer, like many shadows they disappear quickly without one. Some colors are also much different on the skin so don't be afraid to experiment. Sensitive eyes might want to do a swatch test.<br />Comes with double applicators, and a handy inside mirror.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

"DISCLOSURE: I received a sample of this item at no cost in order to test, with the option to review if I so desired.<br /><br />As one that makes a lot of my own skin care preparations, argan oil is a key ingredient in many of them.<br />Mixed with rosehip seed oil and a little emu oil, it makes an excellent lotion for chapped and cracked hands and feet.<br />Adding some avocado oil makes it amazing as a pre-wash hair conditioner.<br />Apply to the hair while it is dry (and scalp if you have a dry scalp), then after anywhere from a minute to an hour, shampoo it out for soft, silky hair.",5
"Used on it's own or as an ingredient in a DIY skin preparation, rosehip seed oil is a multi-use mini-miracle.<br /><br />It can be used on the skin or hair, it even works wonders on dry, ragged cuticles.<br />Rough cracked heels and/or scaly feet? I took equal parts of this oil and emu oil, and rubbed it on my feet after dry buffing. Socks go on, and like me, you will wake up to soft, silky feet.<br /><br />Any oil can go rancid, so keep it in the fridge.<br /><br />Very pleased with the quality of this rosehip seed oil I was given to test.",5
"These are perfect to use a few times when you do a hot conditioner on your hair. They are not the heavy kind that last, but perfect in certain situations. They are similar to hotel shower caps. Easy to pack if you are going to be someone's houseguest.<br /><br />Great for deep conditioning your hair. Slather on the conditioner, put on the cap, and wrap a hot towel around your head.",4
"I bought into some hype and bought a set of Gold masks. You know the ones...expensive face shaped masks that are somewhere between gummi bear and un-gelled Jello. And while using it, you look somewhere between King Tut and C-3PO, the Star Wars robot. Afterward you feel like a Ghostbuster that got slimed.<br /><br />Forget all that and relax with nourishing botanicals. The ingredients soothe and help reduce splotchies and redness.<br />Spa quality facials at home.",5
"This shampoo works fairly well. I am not certain why it is specifically for men. The shampoo lathers easily and leaves my hair soft. It also has a nice scent. The bottle is only 250 ml, whereas most shampoos are at least 400 ml so the price is relatively high for the size.",4
"Look really pretty, easy to clip in and holds well.",5
Gave my face a nice clean feel without drying it out.,5
"Nice smell, left my hair feeling clean. Perfect for little kids who have a hard time pouring out liquid.",5
The little girl loved the brush and the hair ties don't pull her hair out.,5
Left my skin feeling soft and not greasy.,5
"The print is super cute, the stretch is good as I have medium to thick hair and I can wrap twice to do a good bun.",5
Color is pretty and the color split looks good.,5
"No hair pull so far, and great stretch. Worked perfectly for my hair.",5
Did some deep face painting for Halloween and these worked well. Has a clean smell to them and didn't dry my face out.,5
Nice set for a first timer like myself.,5
"Easily wiped off, if you want it to last longer using a makeup setting spray. One of the pallets came broken on the side and they were really oily. But they did stand out in color well, if using multiple colors be patient and let dry so you don't run colors.",3
Nice shade of brown and the hair has a natural thickness to it. Using for a cosplay and it matches. Value for the money.,5
"Great smelling shampoo, used this morning and it still smells good. Doesn't sud up a lot but works good.",5
My husband is always using my face wash so I wanted to get him his own. He says it made his face feel clean but not dry. The smell was really good too.,5
Goes on smooth. Takes a while to soak in and is sticky before being fully absorbed. Excellent results by morning.<br /><br />I like it.,5
A creative dispenser design provides excellent control. I like everything about it. No shine. It makes skin feel like the morning dew.<br /><br />It's pricey and worth it. I will re-buy.,5
"This 6-head Suttik replaces what seems like an identical motor version with 5-heads. This breed of shavers is the first I've ever used in the steamy hot AM shower every day. Day after day. What a time saver! It does a fantastic job. It delivers a better shave than my really high-$ screen shaver.<br /><br />6 heads is an improvement over 5. First, it simply covers more area. This is your head ---> a spheroid with protuberances. The 6-head shaver conforms to stuff like your ears and jawline better. 6-heads get the cutter closer to the nooks and crannies where those obnoxious thickets of long hairs might survive for a couple of days before someone points and say, ""Ewee!""<br /><br />The shaver is small and easy to hold. A charge lasts more than a month. Cleaning is easy. I use shaving cream to lubricate, just like a regular razor. A 'dry' shave in the shower might sound like an oxymoron, but you'll know what I mean when you use it once.<br /><br />I'm sold. Adds at least 5-minutes of goof-off time in my morning routine. I'll take every minute I can gather. Perseverance might payoff with a straight razor shave, but the time saved here to goof off in the AM pays off immediately!<br /><br />It's revolutionary.<br /><br />Was my review helpful? If so, click ""Helpful"" so I can know.",5
"10-year-old super mega-brand vs. SOGUE:<br /><br />1. The SOGUE operates 10K VBM (vibrations/minute) faster. That's why I choose the SOGUE.<br /><br />2. Generic replacement brushes aren't interchangeable between the two. The SOGUE has a smaller shaft. The brushes are also smaller.<br /><br />3. The SOGUE comes with like a year's supply of brushes, unlike the super mega-brand. They are just a tad softer than I prefer. It took me some years to technically discriminate my preferred bristle adjective (soft, medium, hard) for re-order. My brush changing rule is 'new brush for every recharge' as brushes are now so inexpensive. The charges on these toothbrushes have got to be the longest-lasting rechargeable device in the house. It seems like months go by on a charge.<br /><br />4. The SOGUE and brush are about a quarter smaller. It's a noticeable difference. After a minute of thought, I think smaller is likely better as your teeth and the spaces in between are much smaller than you think. Maybe it's getting in tighter corners.<br /><br />5. The SOGUE charges in like 2 hours vs. overnight for the super mega-brand.<br /><br />I was looking at the super mega-brand's newest models at the big-box store. The price is absurd given all the competition from suppliers like SOGUE. The latest super mega-brand models appear the same size as the SOGUE. At a third of the price and assuming the charge life is long, it's a no-brainer. I'll adapt. Most of the difference between the two is a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />SOGUE wins for now. Better than advertised.<br /><br />Was my review helpful? If so, click ""Helpful"" so I can know.",5
The product delivers. It's a nice hyaluronic serum.<br /><br />Value for money. Better than expected.,5
"Really good. As good as hand cream gets.<br /><br />Smooth, super moist (too moist if you handle legal docs too soon after application). Nice scent.<br /><br />Much better than expected.",5
"These are great for traveling, where you may not want to bring along bottles that may leak or cause a problem. These are easy to pop in a Ziploc and carry with you, and are lightweight and very easy to use.<br /><br />I just tested these at home by wetting them in my sink, scrubbing them across my face to clean at the end of the day, and they did a great job getting off sunscreen and oils so that I could do my nighttime facial skincare routine. They did not cleanse overly much to where my skin felt tight or dry, and my skin felt cleansed but still retaining some of its natural moisture.",5
"This has an exceptionally refreshing fragranced with essential oils. Reading the ingredients, I was impressed that the ingredients have detoxifying qualities. It really showed in the experience of how it was to use the salts.<br /><br />Though the instructions said to use the entire bag, I was a little shocked by this because it's a lot of salt and also at the time of purchase, the product was listed at about $35, so it seemed way too luxurious to use the entire thing. However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br /><br />That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br /><br />The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise. I would've expected that in a product that you're supposed to dump out into your bathtub, they would've chosen a smoother stone rather than a rough one. It had some serious sharp angles to it. I would definitely recommend fishing it out before dumping the bag in your bath so that you don't scratch your bathtub. It is beautiful, though.<br /><br />Overall if the price to you seems fair for a single bath, then I highly recommend this product. The quality level is great, it's just a matter of how much do you want to spend for a single bath.",4
"My five-year-old absolutely adores these big, beautiful bows for the hair. The alligator clips are easy for her to use even by herself, and not only does she likes to wear them, but she also loves to put them on her 18 inch American girl style dolls..<br /><br />There is a beautiful array of child pleasing colors and patterns, and these were a big hit at our house.",5
"This is kind of like a cross between a toner and a serum. I have been using it kind of like klairs moisturizing toner, even though it is a little thinner than that. It slaps on and seems to spread over my face nicely, sinks in very quickly, and provides a nice boost of moisture prior to putting on a thicker serum and then moisturizer.<br /><br />I had been reading about this product for really long time before trying it and it's kind of a cult favorite in the K beauty world. I can see why. It's not flashy, but as a first thing to splash on your face and hold in some of that moisture, it works well and doesn't clash with other products.",5
"I love the zingy, fragrant scent of the shampoo. It feels relatively unisex, and doesn't leave a lot of fragrance lingering behind after you rinse it out. I followed up with a peppermint conditioner from the natural food store, and really enjoyed the lovely cooling summer pick me up for my hair.<br /><br />The shampoo is not overly stripping, but definitely leans more towards really getting things clean rather than being overly moisturizing. I found that I could use it about three times a week on my long hair, and then needed to do co-washing or something more moisturizing in between. I really like the shampoo and appreciate having something more herbal like this in my regimen.",5
"My kids and I have been doing a lot of crafting which involves placing tiny sequins and gems on to small painted wooden or clay items, and so while we are not using these for the intended purpose of going on nails, we have been going through these quickly using tweezers to get them out and apply to our craft projects.<br /><br />I've been really impressed with the variety of the sequins, the quality level of them with the thickness and color reflectivity being great, and the quantity given. We all really love these beautiful butterflies and how vivid and fun they are.",5
"The color change works well. The colors themselves though are very translucent. The sparkles are large and sparse, but good quality that somehow doesn't feel rough.<br /><br />It cured up well and had decent durability. Overall I'm happy with the quality. I do wish the bottles made the colors inside a little more obvious.",5
"I shouldn't be surprised, since this brand has an incredibly good reputation for providing a high-end and effective experience, but I was indeed surprised by just how much I love these effective and cooling little gel eye masks. I have tried a number of gel eye masks in the past and found them reasonably pleasant, but this one actually left my skin around my eyes notably moisturized and looking younger for the rest of the day after use.<br /><br />I just put these on in the morning right after my shower and did the rest of my facial and hair care routine, got dressed and by the time I was ready to greet my day, I took off the eye masks and moisturized, and the moisture that the eye masks held in actually seemed to take hold and reduce the fine lines that I usually have around my eyes from lack of sleep and having small children and a business to manage.<br /><br />The fragrance is very light and unobtrusive, and the experience of using these is very luxurious. I have tried other eye masks that did not fit very well around my eye area, but these were shaped very nicely.",5
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this, since most of the products from this line have had some level of fragrance are essential oil to them, but this is a very simple, unscented hand lotion, or rather a thick cream, which applies easily from the fliptop lid in small enough quantities that it is easy to control, and sinks into my skin almost immediately for a very fast effect.<br /><br />As a landscaper, I have a few fingers that remain cracked and peeling for a good portion of the winter, and I've tried a number of different brands of hand cream to fix this. I was really impressed that after only a few days of use, my sides of my fingers of already healed. I didn't expect anything like that, and while I usually prefer to use hand lotions that are scented in some exciting fashion, I am partial to smelling of cupcakes or essential oils, I'm happy to have this simple work horse of a hand cream if it's going to do such a great job.",5
"Desktop Pro 2019 upgraded smoothly and easily with absolutely no issues. I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br /><br />I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br /><br />As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing. I did it myself for many years, but now hand the file back and forth to my bookkeeper via email as a portable file.",4
"This set of fine misters is absolutely perfect for making room sprays, scented toners, and other things with my favorite essential oils. After giving birth, I made a witch hazel spray for healing, I made a tea tree toner to soothe skin during breakouts, and I made a room spray with lavender and eucalyptus to keep in the room with the diaper changers. It's great that this comes in a set of three and that the sprayers put out a fine mist rather than a thick set of droplets. I also really like the cobalt blue color. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.",5
"I had previously been using Lush's Mask of Magnaminty and had really been enjoying it, however I think I was ready for a little bit more of a &#34;grown-up&#34; facial mask to help reduce the appearance of some of the fine lines I have developed in the year since having my son.<br /><br />I have gotten to use this facemask twice and have been super impressed with the results. I am also using the retinol facial moisturizer as well as an ocean mineral toner and cleanser from this brand, and while I was seeing great results from the other products, this mask really supercharged the results. I look like I have had a full nights sleep, which I can assure you I have not! It plumped up some of my wrinkles and just gave my face that dewy fresh appearance that I remember having in my 20s.<br /><br />I received samples of these products to test, but I can't argue with the results. I will certainly be purchasing more from this line.",5
"I’ve tried other brands of argan oil, and have been surprised that some of the brands almost seem more like canola oil or a neutral oil, to where I almost wondered if some of them are counterfeit. Not so with this brand. This brand has the natural scent of the real deal, and is effective to boot. I have a baby, so have been washing my hands about 10 times a day, every time I change his diaper. Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I’d like to caution you that only a few drops are needed. It is very effective and soaks and well, so you only need a very small amount.<br /><br />Overall, this argan oil is one of the best I have found. It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.",5
Beautifully packaged.  Easy to work with.  Amazing results!!  Will buy again!,5
"Absolutely amazing deal AND It Came With Extra Goodies! This Yebo set was one of the “daily deals” and on sale for about $8.50, its UNBELIEVABLE for the price.<br />  I got this thinking my 12 yr old daughter could use it to practice braiding and styling. It came with a head with attached 24” synthetic hair, clamp stand, combs, clips, ponytail holders, bun maker and more. The clamp stand alone is worth $6.<br /> The head has a hole in the bottom to attach it to a tri-pod (Wig stand) if you have one but if you don’t that’s ok, just use the included clamp which easily attaches to any table.<br />  The hair feels good and for the price it’s great for hats, glasses, barrettes, earrings, the possibilities are endless.<br />  This is more than fine for beginners of ANY age. I could see younger kids loving this to play with too.",5
"These Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads work great, they're fast at taking off heavy polish and are perfect for traveling by plane.<br />  Each single packet containd a thick moist pad that did all ten of my fingers in no time which I appreciate. These do have a smell but it's to be expected with any strong polish remover.<br />  There are only 10 packets in the box so as far as price goes, these are costly for regular use but if you have a trip planned or you regularly travel these are perfect.",4
"When looking for a wig I always find pictures to be far more helpful than words. Hopefully the pictures I've included can help someone make a decision. This wig is less than a week (Took a bit of work to get rid of the shine to the point where I felt comfortable). I used dry shampoo and played with the style alot back combing etc..I have been wearing high end LONG human hair wigs so it was a stretch to try this, but I NEED to cut down on the money Im spending and $130 is much better. It has been awhile since I've ordered a Raquel Welch 1. Because I find &#34;Tru Life fibers do not last) especially when you add heat 2. Her wigs move around on me even with/without wig caps, wig bands, It Stays..etc..So I buy combs and clips and sew them in myself just like on a lace wig (its actually much easier on these)..<br />Im happy with this for the price, the fact that it was PRIME and here in 1-2 Days🎈yea!!.. and would order another BUT it does shed quite a bit which is bothering me considering its 3/4 days old.<br />I like where this wig falls on me (which will be different on everyone). The piece that keeps falling in my face is driving me crazy but I will keep &#34;training&#34; it.  Pics are taken in in several different lightings.  There is an RL 14/88 and SS 14/88.. This is the SS..Hope this helps someone..",5
"I’ve gotten similar ones to these before that barely make it through one day, and slightly better ones that can be reused for two or three days. These are probably the best ones I’ve had so far, lasting 3 to 5 times, depending on how thick your hair is and how tight you make it. Nice multipack, especially if you’re on the go, and because they’re small, you can always have a few extra. Comes in 4 resealable bags of 250pcs for easy use and storage.",5
"This patchouli beard wash is awesome, and I’m not gonna lie, it’s also pretty good for the downstairs beard, if you know what I mean. The fragrance is woody and just strong enough to notice from up close, but not so strong that it follows you around everywhere. Gentle on your skin, and leaves hair looking, smelling, and feeling it’s best.",5
"There’s such a strong, sweet, artificial vanilla flavor and smell to this that is cloying and sickening. Yuck. I hate it.<br />Once it sets (about 2-5 minutes, which is longer than most), it looks matte and stays in place very well. It took 4 layers to look fully black on me.<br />Would be 4 stars if it didn’t taste and smell horrible. 3.5 stars",4
"I love witch hazel for cleaning my skin and helping prevent breakouts. This works as expected, though the wipes are quite small, and as far as the packaging goes, the hole to take the wipes out is tiny, so it’s a bit of a pain to get your fingers in there. Otherwise good wipes!",4
"The current price of $17 isn’t bad for something sturdy that can last far longer than plastic equivalents. It comes with 10 razor blades, which because they are double sided, can be reused more often, as well as being able to manually sharpen the blades if you really want to go all the way with sustainability. Speaking of which, this is a superior choice in those terms, as the blades do not have plastic components and involve minimal packaging when ordering refills. Good product—see pic!",5
"This ornate crown in rose gold, tones of amber, and hints of ivory and bronze creates an elegant, striking look that will have the wearer feeling like royalty. The size and proportions make it a grand statement piece that matches with a variety of looks, particularly those with warm or earthy colors. Great quality, doesn’t tangle with hair much, and a bit of weight to make this an absolutely gorgeous accessory.",5
"Wow, these are So much better than using your brush or those plastic scrapers. My tongue has never felt cleaner; furthermore, the next day, morning breath isn’t so bad! Your tongue is so clean from the night before, that your whole mouth just seems more fresh the next day. Absolutely wonderful! Highly recommend.",5
"I’m happy to say that these looked the same as the product photos, and they are individually packaged so that you can give each one as a gift to six different people, or keep them all if you want. Nice amount of fluid, fairly easy application, though you might need to apply it twice to get the right opacity, and once it’s dry, it stays put without smudging.",5
"At the current price of $15 for a set of four, you pay 3.75 per tube. The fragrance is light and vaguely like green tea, but not quite as herbal (too bad—I adore green tea), but it’s still good. As for the texture and moisture—a tiny bit greasy but very moisturizing, perfect for dry hands or feet. Korean skincare is terrific, and these make a great gift with cute little gift boxes.",5
"This four pack of lip color features a fairly limited palette for those who like warm, deep reds. I wouldn’t say it’s the most matte lipstick I’ve ever seen; rather, it has more of an eggshell finish, but they look good for the price and are quite opaque.",4
"This wig is absolutely gorgeous, with a great length and plenty of fullness for a sexy, luxurious look. You can’t tell in my pictures, but in bright light, you can see that hint of burgundy red, and in dark or light, it looks like a natural brown black. The only downside is that the part looks a little bit fake, but other than that, it’s a beautiful wig at a reasonable price.",5
"The rich blue pigment looks stunning for your eyelashes, and it can also be applied to the eyebrows. My only criticism of this is that the new style applicator brushes don’t do as good a job as the longer bristled ones. I have no idea why so many companies have switched over to this design. Also, the liquid is thin enough to be a little messy sometimes. Once you get used to everything, the brilliant color looks great.",4
"I’m not sure what happened, but this is a photo of everything that was included with my kit. It only included one set of 12 colors, and without the others, this actually isn’t very useful to me. I can’t give this more than two stars when it doesn’t have what it said it would. I hope they fixed this, which it appears they have from the other reviews. Shame. It was otherwise fine.",1
"I was so excited about this, and with the price tag, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it caused a pretty dramatic reaction, and my face began to itch and burn. I hate to say it, but for people with sensitive skin, sometimes a long list of natural ingredients isn’t really the best thing. Or at least it wasn’t for me. I feel very uncomfortable and I’m going to go wash my face now. Also, it smelled weirdly chocolatey, which is not something I expected at all, but it’s not a good smell in my opinion. (But if you like that, then you might appreciate this. If you have sensitive skin, this might not work out for you.",3
"This creamy formulation is great for very dry skin, providing lots of moisture that stays locked inside. The ingredients are natural, cruelty free, and don’t irritate my sensitive skin, and it seems to be fragrance free as well. Nice way to pamper your skin",5
"I was concerned that one of the bottles had some bubbling in the plastic, but it turns out it didn’t affect anything, so everything is ok (photo shows this). As for the spray, it produces a Very fine mist — perfect!",5
This is a great set of basics to cover most household needs right now. Happy with the scissors and everything else—DIY life! It’s amazing what you can do with a few simple tools and some tutorials as bd practice. It’s good enough for looking a bit tidier on Zoom!,5
"These no-frills toothbrushes are pretty basic, but they get the job done. The eco-friendly recyclable packaging, plus the bamboo body for the toothbrush, make these a thoughtful choice for those avoiding heavy plastic use. The bamboo will discolor over time, but I haven’t had any health issues related to that. It can look a little mildewy—no big deal. Considering you get a little toothpaste with each box, the price per brush and paste set of $2.60 is pretty reasonable.",5
"This was relatively easy to use and had OK results. Context: my hair is dark dark brown at the root, but I have fashion colors that have faded. The previous color was blue, but part of it faded into various shades of brown, so the underlying color is a little bit uneven. Having said that, because this cream is not very opaque, you can see a lot of the underlying color beneath, so if you are trying to cover anything, this isn’t going to do a great job.<br />The product pictures definitely don’t match the results regardless. Unless you have very light blonde hair, this is only going to provide grayish highlights. That is even taking into account the fact that I was quite generous with this cream. This is the first time I’ve tried a product like this, so I’m not sure how the other brands do, but this was just OK for me. I wouldn’t recommend using this for anything other than some colorful highlights on short hair, maybe not in a color that contrasts too much.",3
"I just got married, and this went to some of the girls who helped out. I absolutely love these post-party favors. They’re useful, cute, and a fun way to say thanks.",5
"I only recently discovered face mist, and it has been such a lovely little treat when I’m feeling stressed or tired. You get a splash of refreshing aromatherapy that lifts your spirits, and in some cases, can moisturize or invigorate your skin a bit. The spray had a hint of rose and sandalwood in the fragrance, coming together to create an earthy and lovely smell. Nice!",5
"I absolutely loved the rose quartz roller! It feels very gentle on your face and your neck, and the cold of the stone is soothing and reduces inflammation. I looked up some videos on YouTube and there is some conflicting information as to which way to use the roller. For the neck, I understand the lymphatic ducts are towards the bottom part of the clavicle, so to me it would make sense that you would roll downward to get the drainage closer to the ducts. In any case, this is a great massaging, relaxing, and skin care tool that looks beautiful.<br /><br />As for the little bottle of tumbled rose quartz chips? No idea. Decorative?",5
"I love the scent of rose, and this face cream cleanser smells just like a freshly picked flower. Absolutely lovely for removing your make up in a way that is moisturizing and leaves behind a beautiful scent.",5
"The very light smell of this is not that bad,  but there’s something kind of weird that lingers, like a weird chemical odor. I mean, everything is chemicals, but I mean it doesn’t smell like any particular oil or plant or herb or spice. It smells kind of plasticky? It absorbs nicely and offers a smooth finish, but I’m just not quite sure how I feel about the fragrance. It’s not bad, and it’s light, so I guess it’s fine. Not the best, not the worst.",3
"Here’s a rundown of each of these great travel products:<br />*Lip balm: incredibly smooth finish, mentholated, neutral minty scent<br />*Scrub: wow! It smells amazing, herbal, and refreshing. The exfoliating stuff is great for preventing blemishes and keeping your skin smooth.<br />*Facial cleanser: where I loved the other products, I just like this. It absorbs nicely, but it just has a standard generic sent. It is, however, subtle scent, even if it is similar to many other types of lotions.<br />*Body wash plus shampoo: awesome, fresh scent with herbal notes. Very invigorating, smells amazing.",5
"I absolutely loved the jade roller and the scraping tool! It feels very gentle on your face and your neck, and there are instructions inside the box on how to use the rose quartz roller, with video links and care instructions for the natural rose quartz (it says jade, but this is rose quartz).<br />I looked up some videos on YouTube and there is some conflicting information as to which way to use the roller. For the neck, I understand the lymphatic ducts are towards the bottom part of the clavicle, so to me it would make sense that you would roll downward to get the drainage closer to the ducts. In any case, this is a great massaging, relaxing, and skin care tool that looks beautiful.",5

"Not only will this trim nose hairs, but it does so without pulling, which really helps. Only needing one AA battery, this small and portable trimmer travels well and doesn’t take up much room.",5
"The colors are pretty nicely saturated (not too transparent or thin) and the shimmery ones look very pretty and subtle--not glittery, just picking up some light. The similarity of color warmth and tone make these ideal for making gradients and smokey eyes, with darker tones near the eyelashes and along the crease, a saturated mid-tone along the crest of the eye and diffusing from the dark/shadow areas, with light highlights under the eyebrows and toward the nose. Nice results with pre-matched, complementary colors.",5
"I love the natural ingredients, and the scent, happily, didn’t smell like vinegar. It was subtle and refreshing, perfect for between hair washes. And that’s just about all it’s good for. This is just a refresher spray. It does NOT help with frizz, not even a little.",3
"After a shower and with wet hair, you apply this cream, and your curls form with a soft set (not hard and crunchy) that look defined and bouncy. It’s light, so you won’t add so much weight that curls turn to waves, and the scent is subtle and delicate.<br />Having said that, this is comparable to cheaper products I use like L’Oréal Curve It Curl Taming Cream, and that’s Much more cost effective (current price of $3.99 Prime).",5
"I have loved the idea of having a pedicure tub, but they're so big and only good for one thing. I love that this not only has all the bells and whistles, it folds flat for storage. It has rollers for massaging, it keeps the water warm so you can keep your feet in as long as you need. There's a remote so you can change modes without bending down. This is like the Cadillac of at home foot spas.",5
"My poor hands are so dry, between the hand washing, dishes doing and home cleaning we're getting dry and cracked over here. I try to keep up with it by using lotions and creams. This is a nice thick hydrating hand cream. It smells really good too, sorta fruity and floral. It doesn't make my hands greasy, it absorbs quickly.",5
"This lotion smells so good! It smells like fresh squeezed lemonade and sugar, its so refreshing. The texture is great, its nice and lightweight. I typically put on lotion after a shower and it leaves my skin feeling soft and well hydrated. It takes a bit to absorb, but by the time I'm finished getting all my parts the first limb I started with is dry. The scent doesn't last long, which for me is sad, its so good! but I know that can be too much for some people. This lotion keeps my skin hydrated for days, but I might need a refresher in the winter.",5
"If your bath or shower is missing something, this might be it! This scrub is so nice and cozy. It smells amazing, like a cup of hot cocoa. It has great grains for exfoliation, there's different sizes to make sure your skin gets the best exfoliation. The mask in it is great to keep your skin soft and smooth too. For the ultimate treatment put a thick cream on after this and your skin will glow!",5
"This lotion does a great job of moisturizing, it smells very tropical. It comes in a bottle with a flip type lid and the lotion is so thick, it is rather difficult to get it out. If you use a thin layer it absorbs relatively quickly and my skin was nice and moisturized for at least 24 hours.",4
"I have been trying to have green hair for a while now, but inevitably in a few washes it fades to blue. I have tried several yellow dyes on top of the blue and this is the first one to stick around through a few washes. I washed my hair, towel dried it and then fairly thoroughly applied this dye throughout my hair. There is an unfortunate scent to it, I don't know how to describe it other than old pee. It goes away when your hair dries, but through the first two washes when your hair is wet you can smell it. I left the dye on overnight like I usually do and rinsed in the morning. I didn't see much of a conditioning or repairing effect, but it definitely got the green right. It is slowly rinsing out of my hair, but I am impressed with the brightness and longevity.",4
"My boyfriend's face has been really dry and flaky lately and I needed to get something he would use and something that would work. This lotion is lightweight, but very moisturizing. It has a light pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering and dissipates pretty quickly. I appreciate that the flaky skin and dryness went away too!",5
"These cloths are the best for getting your skin soft and keeping it well exfoliated. The cloths really get your soap lathered up too, don't get them too much in the water because the soap will rinse right out. You can also use these exclusively for scrubbing your skin, if you soak in the tub you can use the cloths to roll your dead skin right off. Its gross and so satisfying. Follow up with a nice bath oil and or lotion and you are good to go.",5
"My hair is dry and damaged from bleaching for fun colors. I try to treat it to moisturizing and repairing products in between bleachings so it doesn't look like a haystack. I have been shampooing, rinsing, towel drying and then sectioning and applying conditioner to my hair and leaving it over night, rinsing in the morning. This deep conditioning mask fell a little short of my expectations. It was an easy consistency to work with and worked well in to my hair. It smells minty and kind of herbal, that was really pleasant. My hair wasn't quite as quenched as I was hoping for, it feels more like a regular conditioner than a deep conditioning mask. I would definitely continue to use it as such, but I would not likely buy it again.",4
"This kit has almost everything you could need as a new parent, or a good refill kit for your toddler. The shampoo/body foam is light and cleanses gently, but completely. The lotion is super hydrating, but lightweight and doesn't leave your skin greasy. The oil is nice for a heavier moisturizing treat, it is calming at night. The wipes are great when you are out and about, they are good at getting sticky messes cleaned up. Everything has no scent and just feels really gentle.",5
"My skin looks hydrated and feels soft. I double cleanse with an oil and a foaming cleanser. I used the Ordinary exfoliating acid and then a toner. I put the eye cream on thick and put the sheet mask on top of it. I left it for 20 minutes and then took off the mask. I tapped in the extra serum until it was dry. I put the night pack on and went to bed. In the morning my skin felt so soft and was hydrated. It was a little much for my nose area, I got a very full whitehead the next day, but my nose is very oily. This is a nice treat once a week.",5
"This kit is pretty easy to use. I clean my face and then let a warm washcloth lay on it until it's cool. The bottles of formula have nail polish brushes in them to make it easy to apply the product where you need it. I put this on my nose, but you can use it wherever you have clogged pores. Once the liquid is on, you press the strip onto your face and then wait. It dries quicker than other pore strips I've used. After a little more than 5 minutes it was ready to peel. After peeling I looked at the strip and I could see the little hairs and stuff that came out of my skin. My nose feels smoother and looks clear. I wiped my face and my nose in particular with a toner pad and proceeded with a serum and moisturizer. This is a really easy to use kit that will last a while.",4
"This oil is fantastic for dry skin! I put it on right after showering and gently dried off with a towel, my skin felt so soft and hydrated. It smells like a tropical daydream too, which is great! Use the oil sparingly so your tub doesn't get slippery!",5
"I like using a shampoo brush, they really help the shampoo work to its fullest when I'm cleaning my hair. The nubs are gentle, but they get down to your scalp even through thick hair. There are holes in the bottom of the brush so you might want to remove the part with the bristles and let that dry out to keep the mold out. There are a bunch of brushes in this pack so if it gets bad you could easily replace it. These are great as a part of a spa gift or for yourself.",5
"This is a fun easy mask to use. I put it on after a harsher exfoliation for a little TLC. It goes on easily, just pump it out and spread it on thinly over your face. Make sure your face is damp so it has something to activate. It starts bubbling quickly and tickles a little and then a lot! The big clumps of bubbles will pop and flatten on your face and when most of them were popped I wet my hands and rubbed the mask on my face. After rinsing with a washcloth my face felt good and looked brighter. It had a little hydration to it, which was a bonus. It does have a heavy floral/musk scent so if you are sensitive to smells this might not be for you.",5
"If you have a large head and plan on wearing this for a long period of time it might not be comfortable. I have a normal ish size head and it pressed my earrings into my head which wasn't comfortable, but I'll just take my earrings out next time. The side that sits on your forehead has a sticky strip to keep the cap from sliding and the side that goes on the base of your skull has a stretchy band to allow for sizing. The bow is cute and so is the pattern. I use these types of caps for incubating oil and deep conditioning masks. They are great for this, keeps the ""juice"" inside and the outside dry.",4
"This is one of my favorite facial moisturizers! It is lightweight on your face, but not in hydration. I use this as my night time lotion, and whenever my face needs some TLC. It is super hydrating, my face feels amazing and looks so good when I use this.",5
This set is great for a nice facial massage. I like using the roller over my safety makes to make sure they stay in place and help the serum into my skin. The cool feeling of the stone is super soothing. The gua sha is a nice massage with a moisturizer or serum too. It comes nicely presented and would make a great gift.,5
I like using these weekly with a sheet mask. They really help hydrated my under eye skin and keep the dark circles at bay. There's a ton in the jar so they'll last a while.,5
"I like to layer this on top of my moisturizer if my face feels particularly dry. This sinks in and goes to work keeping your face hydrated and not tight. There is sort of an odd scent to it, but it isn't overpowering. I have heard great things about prickly pear oils and this definitely lived up to my expectations.",5
"This is a great thick, deep, moisturizer for your face. It is amazing when the wind or cold or dry air chaps your skin. A little bit goes a long way with this. It soaks in easily and hydrates all day.",5
"This soap smells very mild and not very much like bergamot. It lathers and cleanses well, my skin feels squeaky clean. The bar is nice and hard so it will last a while.",4
"After cleansing and toning I smoothed this sheet mask on my face and left it about 20 minutes. After taking it off I tapped the excess into my skin until it was dry. I applied my normal moisturizer and went to bed. In the morning my eyelid was swollen and my face felt very tight and almost plastic coated. I washed my face right away, but the swelling persisted until the next day. That was the only new thing I tried on my face that day. Be cautious!",3
"Ok, so when you open the box this thing seems kind of suspect. It smells like it is made of layers of spray paint and it feels like it is going to fall apart as soon as you get it wet. Let me just say, one trip through the wash and it held up and it smells much better. It fits great and conforms to your face, it is tight against your nose and cheeks and the chin to keep air in/out. It is breathable, but the good way.",5
"I use q tips to get water out of my ear, these won't do that. They are good for getting excess earwax out or gentle scratching if need be. There are lots of different tips to choose from and spares if you need. The case is flexible and made of silicone as well. There is a really nice mirror on the opposite side of the ear buds. The hinge(connector part?) between the two sides seems very flimsy like it might break, but so far it has held up.",4
"My hair is dry and damaged from bleaching and  I try to do all I can to keep it happy and healthy. I shampooed my hair, towel dried and added conditioner to my hair and combed it through. I put on a shower cap and a towel wrap and slept on it. In the morning I rinsed it out and let it air dry. It felt reasonably moisturized and looked good. I usually wash twice a week and switch between conditioner and hair mask. The scent is different than any I have smelled in a conditioner, but it isn't bad and it doesn't really stay around. There was no seal on the conditioner and it was all over the box when I got it, but it was only a little bit.",4
"This is an oily consistency, but it sprays easily and there is a heavy stream. I was surprised by that at first, but managed to rake it evenly through the rest of my hair. It soaked in pretty quickly and left my hair nice and soft and even though I accidentally over applied, it looks decent and not like an oil slick. There is a light scent that is ok, it doesn't hang around though so that's fine.",5
"These are very juicy, I squeezed some off before putting on my face. The mask smells fresh and a little like rubbing alcohol. It's wider than long, like really wide so it fits weird on your face. The eye and mouth holes are thin and wide so it hung over my eyes and my mouth. I left it on for 20 minutes and tapped the leftover serum on my face and it made my face feel nice and moist.",4
"Lots of great stuff in here, face brush, eye mask, cleanser, wipes, nose strips, eye mask, lip mask, its a great pampering box.",5
"I put this on in the morning before my 16 hour shift and within a few hours I could feel irritation in my armpits. It got worse over the day and by the time I was done working my armpits were red and swollen. The only positive was the scent, the lavender smelled really good and strong and I didn't stink at the end of my shift.",2
It's long enough to get around your back and sturdy enough to not flip around when you are scrubbing your back. It has a scrubby side and a massaging nubby side. They both feel great on your skin. It came with a little natural sponge and several sticker hangers for in the shower that come in handy to help them dry better.,5
"What I got was a zippered plastic bag with a bunch of pink and orange curlers and two halves of a hook stick. There were no instructions included, but I was able to find some information on how to use these. So I washed my hair and towel dried it and then tried putting these things in. I learned: use less hair, maybe separate top parts from bottom parts, somehow make sure they're dry before removing. I used too much hair in some of mine and they didn't turn out. They weren't very comfortable, I can't imagine sleeping with them in. Maybe it'll be better if I use smaller chunks of hair.",4
"I love these foot masks. My feet are relatively smooth but these help keep them in tip top shape. I make sure to soak my feet for 15-20 mins in warm water before putting the booties on. I put a soak on top of each foot and leave them as long as 2 hours before washing them off. Then starting the next night you have to soak your feet 20 mins each night. This jump starts the peeling. There was a foot razor in the package, which I had always thought you weren't supposed to use with these.",5
"Usually my eye cream is enough to keep my under eyes happy, but sometimes they need a little extra. These gels do the trick perfectly. I usually put them on after I wash my face and I do a sheet mask on the rest of my face over the top of these so everything comes out nice and smooth and hydrated. They are packed with goodness and that sinks right into your skin.",5
"This is a great set if your hands regularly get dirty or dry. There's a barrier cream that can be used as a hand lotion, charcoal exfoliating hand soap, and a thick hand cream. There is a faint scent, but it's clean smelling if anything. The soap says you can use it with or without water. I wouldn't eat anything with my hands without using water with it though. The heavy cream is really nice to out on just before bed, just the tiniest amount will take care of your hands. Both creams soak in quickly and aren't greasy at all. I wash my hands it seems like a thousand times a day and these keep them from being tight and dry.",5
"These are super cute and really soft. I think I have a normal size head, but these fit really tight, like I have to scrape it over my face to get it on my head. I'm hoping they'll stretch a little with use, because it's not very comfortable to wear longer than washing my face. I haven't tried a face mask yet, I don't really know if I could handle the pressure.",4
"This is a nice creamy body wash, I use it for myself. It is very mild, but lathers nicely. The scent is very light, the bottle says lavender, but you can barely tell.",4
"I wanted to get a bottle like this to use for homemade hydrating mists for my face or moisten my hair for treatments. There aren't any instructions other than to clear the tube in case it gets stuck. It says it's a continuous spray and through a brief trial and error I discovered you pump the handle to prime the spraying mechanism and that makes it basically a continuous spray. The pump is really easy to operate, you can easily squeeze it with one finger. When you put the top back on you have to push it down and then it's just like a half or quarter turn to keep it on. One of the questions was would I take it when I travel and it's a little too bulky to bring it with on all trips. If I think I would need it or have tons of room in my suitcase maybe.",4
"I got a packet in a subscription box. I've tried a few other foot peels and have had way more success. I always soak my feet for about 15 mins before, leave them on for the suggested time and soak my feet for 15 mins each night until they stop peeling. My feet didn't start peeling for about 5 days after and it was only the soles of my feet. I was hoping it would take care of the calluses on the heels of my feet, but so far no deal.",3
"This is fabulous box full of everything you need to relax in the tub and after you get out! Everything that comes in this set smells amazing and is made with good quality ingredients! The box would make a perfect gift for a loved one, or even yourself. Have a self care spa day at home and treat yourself with this lovely bath and body set.",5
"These hair ties are a tighter tie similar to name brand like conair. Right off the packaging they are too tight tight wear around wrist but work well to hold hair in place. Haven't had any break or anything so far, so overall good hair ties so far!",4
"This was my first time using a foot peel, so I feel like this product didnt provide enough information for first time users. Directions said to put booties on feet. I wasnt sure if i should take them out of the plastic, so i didnt because there was alot of liquid in them. The packets also said to not use if you are breastfeeding or pregnant so that was concerning - not sure what is in it or how it effects milk, but i still pump for my daughter. I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses. Idk if I was suppose to keep socks/ slippers off  during this time but it didnt completely work for me for whatever reason. Maybe if they provided a more detailed instruction process I couldve been more successful?",3
"i get frequent puffiness under my eyes. The usual go to is a frozen spoon or ice cube, but came across this and decided to get it. Its easier to use and more convenient.  You dont have to worry about your hand getting cold because the roller part is the only thing that goes in the freezer. It gently massages and soothes eyes and other areas youd like to treat. I think this would also make a nice gift! It is a little bigger than expected so it may be harder to reach small areas.",4
"These are sturdy glass bottles. I have a couple amber colored bottles but I wanted to get a couple glear bottles. The spray nozzles have long tubes that go all the way down to the bottom of the glass bottle so you could get every last drop out! The spray top only has 2 options: off and on, and the on is a very fine misted spray- No stream setting like most bottles, so that could be a con depending on what you want to use it for. It would be ideal for misting (like plants or hair) I will also be using these for making my own cleaning products.",4
"I got this to use on my 1 year old! The quality seemed great (all natural, organic and enhanced with fulvic acid!). Ithought it could help her sleep better especially on nights where she is having a hard time (due to teething for an example.) Its easy to apply, rubs in and absorbs well but does feel a little sticky afterwards. It doesnt have much of a smell either maybe a little like lavender but gentle. Ive been doing one pump and rubbing it on her feet and she likes the little foot massage. I could tell it helps her sleep better. She wakes up/squirms less, maybe helping her get a deeper sleep. Very happy to have this for the rough nights.",5
"Disappointed in this product because it did not work for me. I took a couple pictures showing and comparing my eyelashes before and after applying. The mascara was a little pastey but step 1 applied ok and looked fine, but step 2 completely ruined my eyelashes. It looked horrible; The left side got clumped together and the right side looked like my eyelashes were growing baby eyelashes. Very unnatural looking. This claims to be flake free but after it dried i noticed a few little black specks on my cheeks. I had to use one of my old dried up mascara brushes to separate my lashes to fix them. It's also very hard to wash off.",1
"This mister is awesome! I got it to use on my house plants and it works great. It holds a little of 5oz, the mist very fine, handle is easy to pull, and it's a continuous spray for few seconds per handle pump! Might consider using on my hair in the future too!<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions about my review, or if you have found it of any help to you.",5
i searched &#34;dark brown eyebrow tint&#34; and this came up and i was about to make the purchase until i fully read the description &#34;This product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes and eyebrows. To do so may cause blindness&#34; so i dont know why people are condoning the use of this product on their eyebrows/ eye area. i guess they dont care there is a chance of losing eye sight. also amazon needs to remove this from results for eyebrow tint... glad i saw before i bought!,3
"This left my face feeling really greasy and weighted. It did not work for my normal skin. If you have dry skin, then it would work better for you.",1
"This works fast to remove my poly gel nails. I file away the top coat, apply this, and then file again. I will typically have to repeat this several times for it to come cleanly off. But its so much better for my nails than popping them off.",5
Smelled like vapor rub cream and burned and tingled my skin. I threw it away and wasn't able to use it at all.,1
"My daughter liked this sun screen but when I used it I had mixed options. I could tell that it contained alot of alochol and it would even burn small cuts that I can in places. It worked and provided great protection... just be careful, because it can irritate small wounds.",4
"This perfume smells really good and I love the presentation of it. However, after about 15 minutes... you can’t smell it at all... if you can keep spraying it then it would be great.",3
You might as well be wearing nothing with this. It does not work and on top of it not working at the product itself smells terrible. I would not recommend this,1
"This was way too difficult to use. Once I did figure it out, there just simply isn't enough powder in this kit to do all of your nails one color. Esp not for the price. I did not like this product",1
"This lotion smells really good! I always use it in the spring and summer when it is warmer outside since it smells ""beachy.""  It applies very smooth and helps to moisturize my dry skin. I love it.",5
I ordered these to use when I did my dip powder nails. The board is too limber and bends and the grit isn't good. I would not recommend these if you are getting them for artificial nails.,1
[[VIDEOID:f91883e6659d6d0301b169edd5f0a605]] I love teleties! They are great for your hair. I hope my video review helps!,5
I really like this hand soap. The jar/bottle that it comes in is very sturdy and well made. I was so impressed by the bottle. The soap gets my hands very clean. It doesn’t smell the best though which is why I removed one star and didn’t give it 5 stars.,4
I’m torn on this soap. The packaging is really nice which would make it a great gift. However at the lavender smell is just a little overwhelming to me. This soap would best go in a guest bathroom and to be used as a hand soap.,3
These clippers are amazing. Such a great price for so many too. They keep a secure hold on my daughters thin hair. They are well made too. Very happy with these!,5
"This lotion is amazing... However the biggest thing to remember when using this product is that a little goes a LONG way. I at first got alot to apply to my leg and I don't think that I could have rubbed that much into my entire body. However, this is a really great product and it smells AMAZING! Just like what you would want to smell at the beach! It really does give you an instant tan.",5
"I ordered these mostly for the ""clippers!"" My daughter has thin/fine hair that is hard to stay back at times... and she uses the clippers at school to keep her hair out of her eyes. These work great and for the amount, you can alot more than going to your local store and buying them. The ponys are soft and also hold her hair up great. I would recommend them!",5
"My experience with these buffer files is only for using them with dip powder nails. I always do my own and have been buying buffer blocks from the local beauty supply store for years for .99 cents. When I saw these, I thought that it would be perfect for me. I was wrong. These blocks do absolutely nothing. I tried to use them all. There is very little grit on the blocks at all so it was a task trying to smooth the surface of my nail. If you are needing them for something else they may work for you. But I wouldn't advice them if you are getting them to do your own nails.",1
My daughter is 4 and FINALLY has hair long enough to wear big bows. We have always used the Wee one bows and they are great but they always slip out of her fine hair. The quality of the bow material isn't as good as the wee ones but they are still great. BUT the clip is what makes all of the difference in these bows. They are little teeth so they stay in her hair like the others do not. plus the price. I'm used to paying $13 for one bow... so I am obviously thrilled with these bows!,5
I do my own dip nails so I need a strong acetone based product to remove the nails when I am ready to take them off. This did not disappoint. Great product and a great price. I will use this again!,5
"I really like this straightener for the most part. I'm not sure how... but my hair (and my daughters) seems to come from the wand so much shinier. It has an adjustable temperature setting, it does lock closed. It even comes with a bag to keep it in and a glove to wear while you are using it... which is where I have my problem. The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price... Its a great wand. You will get used to where you need to hold your hand.",4
"This lamp is super easy to use. After installing the batteries you just turn it on the length of time that you need and you are ready to go. I do dip powder nails, not gel... but everytime I have been to the salon, they have always used a lamp to help cure the top layer faster. This worked exactly the same. Anything that saves me time is a great thing! I would recommend this. the price is great and the product is even better!",5
"These are great as regular headbands but not so good for strapping your mask to.  The material is so so soft which is nice from a comfort standpoint but it isn’t rigid enough to support the buttons on it so my mask straps just pull the buttons away from the material and fall off.  I am going to try sewing the buttons through both sides of the fabric to see if that helps but it’s annoying that they aren’t working for their intended purpose.<br /><br />Additionally, one of the buttons fell off almost immediately which again, doesn’t help with the mask situation.",3
"On my hunt for something to nourish my extra dry skin, I came across this moisturizer which seemed fairly promising.  I love a more lightweight moisturizer that doesn’t look greasy and this fits the bill.  It absorbs completely and makes your skin feel hydrated and plump.  I wear a lot of foundation and it goes over this moisturizer nicely without causing any weird texture or breakage.  Unfortunately with the cold weather now upon us, it still isn’t quite enough to keep my skin hydrated all day and I do start to feel tight after a few hours.  For me, this will be great in the warmer months but I just need a little bit more out of a cream in the winter.  I think it is a great moisturizer for most people, just maybe not enough for those of us with desert dry skin.",4
I love a statement piece - and these headbands definitely fit the bill. They are oversized and super blingy. What’s not to love!? I recently wore to a brunch with friends and I got so many compliments. It’s a nod to an 80’s headband but with a chic modern take. Obsessed.,5
"What’s not to love!? Nothing is worse than painting your nails only to mess half of them up 30 mins later! I’ve resorted to at-home nails since quarantine. I’ve done dip powder and these. I actually prefer the strips because it takes a fraction of the time, it can last me over 10 days and it’s a lot easier to remove. This was my first time trying this brand. It really seemed to grab around the edges which made it easy to file off the excess with a good seal to the nail!",5
"These are great. I feel so much better knowing that our toothbrushes are protected when they are not in use. I'm kind of a fanatic about germs so this is a tremendous help. They fit the tip of the brushes securely and are so easy to keep clean. This is a must-have in my household, especially with the kids. What a nifty little product and value.",5
These are so cute. They are made really well and the materials are strong. These are actually comfortable to wear and they stay in place. These are really versatile. They fit me and my l’il girl. I can’t believe they stayed in her hair with all the rolling around and pulling on it like a 3 year old does. This is a great value and the colors are lovely.<br /><br />*If my review of this item is helpful please hit the helpful button below to let Amazon know. Thank you!,4
"This is an okay cleanser but it feels like I’m washing my face with lotion so my face doesn’t feel clean at all. And there is too much of a good thing here regarding the scent, it’s nice but way too strong and the few times that I used this I actually got a migraine from it. I had to be sure it was because of the scent so I used it a few more times and yes it’s the scent, it gives me a big ole migraine. What on earth does that say about the health of this product. Not good that’s for sure.",1
"I’m not too crazy about this one. It doesn’t work on my hair. There were no beach waves and it was incredibly awkward to use. I’m not sure if it’s the waver design or what but it definitely doesn’t like me. It ended up with my daughter and she didn’t like much either. Usually if something like this doesn’t work for me, it usually works for her, but not this time. Too bad to I love all things pink.",2
"I absolutely love this mascara. It comes in a really stylish container so extra points for presentation. I love that it doesn’t go on or even remotely look clumpy. I haven’t noticed any extra volume but to be honest that is what I like about this, it is thin and is very minimal. This lasts all day without smearing but it is super easy to wash off.  This is fairly inexpensive but I can tell it is not cheaply made. The applicator still looks squeaky clean. Even my usual brand’s applicator would be clumped up by now and I pay a fortune for that stuff. I’m really happy with this product. It’s perfect for me.",5
I am always in need of a good curling iron and this one is okay but it is a little bigger than I would like for it to be. I really love all the settings this one has. This has two buttons that control the temperature up or down and it has a little window to show what the current temp is. The maximum temperature is 350 and it reaches that rather quickly. It has a switch that controls the speed of the twirl low or fast. Then there is a button to control the direction you want to curl your hair left or right and it has a home button to return the iron to the correct home position. This has a flipper that is about an inch to start your twirl but it leaves crease marks in your hair that cannot be corrected unless you re-wet it and start all over. It really needed a heat resistant glove because no matter how skilled you are at this you are going to try and wrap your hair with your hand so it is a high probability of user error which will probably result in a burn. This is a really nice gray and white. I do like this curling iron it just has a few hiccups.,3
"These razors are awesome. They easily let you get to areas that are difficult with regular razors. You need to figure out the best way for you though, if you go the wrong way, it can pull the hair. Love them!<br /><br />1 star - awful! want my money back!<br />2 stars - bad but not horrendous<br />3 stars - decent/good<br />4 stars - really good!<br />5 stars - awesome! definitely recommend!",5
I got the headbands for my girls who are 5 and 10 years old. They fit them both nicely and are not too tight. The multitude of colors ensure they go with many different outfits. The headbands stay on and do not slide off. They are decently made.,5
"First day use, by the end of the day brown hair clip suddenly gave out. The loop that held the spring just broke while my daughter was resting. Not too sturdy. Next day we tried matte black clip, and it's holding steady but now I have to be gentle with it. The hair bands are a nice bonus as well as the storage box it all came with. So some of them are sturdy, some of them are flimsy. But they hold up hair well and tight.",3
"The soap came in a plastic bag. The bars are pretty small but they give off a nice scent. They lather well and do leave skin softer than after use of regular soap. The only problem is that you use it once, and it starts to disintegrate. It turns into mush that can be scooped up from the soap dish. Even if you completely dry it, it still disintegrates. I like using it but I wish it would keep its shape.",4
"This roller is made out of lightweight plastic base and a a little sturdier roll that seems to be filled with some kind of gel. The roll is removable and needs to be put in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. Then it's easily inserted back. It feels great on my face in the morning, wakes me right up and sort of revitalizes, plus I use it on my neck to close the pores. It works great with localized pain when you need something cold to bring  immediate relief. I must say it hold cold for a while, so one session will last however long you need. Good roller for pain relief and natural cosmetic treatments.",5
"The wipes come in a sealed like regular wipes package that goes inside little plastic container with a lid. The wipes have pleasant scent, remove make up really well from eye shadow to mist water that is pretty thick. It leaves skin clean and moisturized. I like using them. The size is enough to remove a good chunk of make up at one time.",5
"This chapstick is tasteless and has no smell. Unlike many others, when applied it does not leave lips feeling greasy - it starts working right away. Lips are moist, supple, and it stays on for long periods of time. I like it. I have a bad habit of peeling my lips, and when this chapstick is on, I do not have the urge to do it.",5
"This is a very good shampoo for everyday use. It has wonderful scent that keeps hair smelling great long after the shower, gets hair clean and moisturizes scalp well. I like using it.",5
I LOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEEE ITTTTTTTT!!!!!!!,5
"For the price I find it hard to give this set many stars. There are two packs of nail polish, so you do get ten small bottles. However, there's like 8 colors to choose from because glitter and pink are duplicate. One teal is dried up and can't be used. Does take a long time to dry up. I wouldn't consider this a beauty item, instead, it's pretend play toy 100%. The stickers are extremely tiny and difficult to remove. When I tried to remove it from the package a couple stickers fell off of the plastic film. I did like how there's no strong odor to it and feels safe if my kids want to play with these. I can't give it more stars because overall these don't feel worth the price of $11.",3
"I was very satisfied upon opening this wig.  It looks real.  It feels real.  It is so light and cool for summer wear.  I think the part I love the most about it is the fact that the cut and style are foolproof-not a lot of styling on this wig to get the result.  Even for a synthetic wig, it is so natural looking, and the cap fits to the scalp nicely.  This wig is my new go to wig for everyday wear.  I have received so many compliments and I am so pleased with the results!",5
"I decided to give this product a try.  It is probably one of the most revolting products I have ever used.  The charcoal powder is put on a wet toothbrush and then you brush.....and the taste is disgusting.  The black spew dirtied the sink, and required me scrubbing it after each use.  As for the whitening properties, I could see no difference with the exception of the fact after scrubbing my teeth with this noxious powder, I had to brush my teeth with my toothpaste 3 separate times to get rid of the black mess.  I was really disappointed in this product, and couldn't give a recommendation for this.  It was simply disgusting.",1
"Almay products have been very reliable for me for sensitivity issues. I am not a make up pro by no means, however this works well for my tastes. Applies easily and stays but. We are having very mild weather at the moment so I am curious about it’s staying power through higher temperatures and heavier humidity. My lashes are thin so this does effectively help to make my lashes appear fuller and darker without clumping. Pleased so far with this product.",4
I have very dry skin and I love how it moisturizes. My skin is soft without feeling greasy.  I just wished it had a stronger scent.<br /> I also bought the Hippie Peace and it has an amazing scent as well as wonderful moisturizing.,4
"Mis hijas y mi esposa están fascinadas con el producto, sencillo, económico, fácil de usar y lo más importante: te ahorra mucho dinero.",5
Nice brush,5
"It's a great shampoo,  but I have to use medicated shampoo intermittently so my scalp doesn't get to much build up.",5
"This Auto Hair Curler is really a cool concept, you just insert your hair and listen for the beeps and then pull your hair out and it's instantly curled. It works better with longer hair and with hairspray the curls hold.",4
"smells nice and cleans your beard well. you have to use conditioner, will leave your beard feeling dry.",5
240 Pieces Halloween Party/ Ball Press on False Nails. This set comes with so many different designed nails. They are all Halloween themed. I use these with Kiss nail glue and they do great. They lasted around a week in a half. Really comfortable and easy to apply.,4
"These were not great nails, they wear very short and ill-fitting and the designs had china written all over them.",2
"This is a really nice set. The jade roller and Gua Sha are pretty pink. I do use them regularly to massage my face especially at my jaw line, not sure if you can really tell a difference. Still a nice set.",4
I really like using these masks. These leave my face feeling moisturized and smooth after using. They are not heavily scented.,4
This Eye Shadow Switching Pan is great to help clean your brushes in between colors and uses. I do see the color on the sponge but I haven't seen any kick back on in the tin. So I guess it is working. It is easy to switch and clean.,4
"What I love about these magnetic lashes set is the lashes, you get 5 full sets of lashes that are all voluminous and look great on. The problem is the liner its, not the greatest, it's tacky and doesn't hold the lashes as well as other sets I have tried. I use the lashes with other liners and they work.",3
"I am in love with this Magnetic Eyelashes kit. I have tried other brands before and really hated the eyeliner. This set has a precision eyeliner. It goes on so smooth and straight really love it and it makes the eyelashes to stick easily. I will say that you have to really apply a good amount of eyeliner all the way across the lid for the magnetic strips to work. It does take time and practice to really get the hang of these, but I find them so much easier than glue.",5
"I have 4 daughters and we all wear these headbands. These are very comfortable and we really like the turban style more than the pearl, it just looks really fancy. We wear the turban headbands for everyday wear, they wear them to school, which I like it keeps their hair out of there eyes.  These are all sturdy and comfortable, with no irritation to my head or behind my ears. I wear them and my kids all wear these so they fit everyone. I like that the fabric covers the entire band so nothing is sticking or poking your head. This set has 9 headbands my daughter has one on and not pictured.",4
"Really cute set of functional scrunchies. These are really well made and hold up hair all day. I like that each one is different, they are each super soft made with a velvet feeling material. These are great for putting up your hair in a quick minute.",5
"These are cute in the picture and they look adorable in my kid's hair, but they are inconsistent, only two have the really long material and they are not the best colors to match any of our clothes. The others have the short little ties and they just feel really cheap. They come pretied and all of the shorter Scrunchies are dull in color. My older kids like to wear them on their wrist but they don't like these they felt itchy, We will still wear them but mostly around the house.",3
"My teenager is a nail fanatic, she changes her nail color at least twice a week. She loves using this dryer, it's easy to operate and cuts down on drying time. It was harmless, and it works with all kinds of nail polish, not just Gel. It is really fast and would be great if you are in a hurry. My daughter approves",4
"Everything about this product  is false advertising. It is not waterproof at all, I could stand in front of the fan and it will come off.🤨 It only comes with one shape and is crazy long and unnatural. Don’t waste your money 💵 it is not worth it. I’m very disappointed ☹️",1
"The picture shows this product coming in a pump bottle. It would be fine in a pump bottle. It came in a tub instead and it is way too thin to be useful in a tub. One of my kids knocked it over pretty much first thing and it quickly almost all dumped out. Getting enough on my hands from the tub is also difficult just because it's so thin. It is fine for my daughter's hair, but it left my boys' hair kind of flat and dull looking. Definitely not impressed.",2
"While these pumice stones shave down dead skin and calluses nicely, they don't last long and break easily. The colored side is pretty much useless.",3
This set works great. It makes it super easy to keep your beard neatly trimmed. It also works super well for cutting hair. You can even use it to cut designs into hair. It's really super useful. It's feels high quality and like it will last through a whole lot of uses.,5
These cloths remove make-up very easily.  They leave my face feeling super clean.  The scent is very nice.  I really like them.,5
"These headbands fit very loosely.  This is good on the one hand because it means you are less likely to get a headache by the end of the day from wearing one.  On the other hand, it is bad because it means they slip easily and don't hold hair in place very well.  The braided part is very pretty, but the black plastic of the headband is wider than the braid and so shows while you are wearing it and that looks rather weird.  The braid feels like it could come off easily as well, like it is not glued on super well.",3
"I really like that there are several identical pieces in each color in this set.  Too often one will get lost and then you only have one left.  The barrettes clip open and closed easily.  The elastics are very stretchy and work just as well in adult hair as in little girls' hair.  They hold the hair in place, too, with little to no slipping.",5
"Great wig.  For this price I was really surprised when it came in, I was very skeptical but the reviews were great.  The hair feels nice and you can brush it and rub your fingers through it like it's real hair.  Very good quality for the price I bought both colors. Definitely recommend buying this wig.",5
"Have used the whole jar, no visible results. The smell is horrid! Had to make sure I applied this only if I knew I would not be around anyone. Stunk up my sheets terribly.",2
"Love this polish because it stays on and does not quickly crack and peel.  The only thing is I did not get to choose the colors, and some of the colors sent were not my taste.",4
I wanted to love this product. It made my underarms itch like crazy the. I got red welps; but not my groin. Go figure.,2
A Very good Mary kay product. Love their products.,5
"These seem like decent lashes. They are curly. The price is good for the number included. They do not come with glue which is annoying. They are easy to trim, apply and remove. While not a natural look they are not overly dramatic. They are soft and fluffy.",4
I lije the ingredients and the company's mission. Not sure why they call it a mask. It applies  like any other moisturizing cream. It is not perfumed but has a light scent. It absorbs quickly. My skin felt smoother after use though not softer. I like it.,4
This serum is easy to apply. Fragrance free it is non-irritating.  I used it on both my lashes and brows. After eight weeks there was minimal improvement. It seems to enhance the natural growth cycle. Sparse brows and lashes will not turn long and luxurious.,3
"This set is a goid way to try these products. There are travel sized containers of an exfoliator and a moisturizer and four samples of oils, two cleansing and two nourishing. The exfoiliator has a light fragrance. It is gentle and effective. The moisturizer smells  stronger and less pleasant. It does make skin look and feel soft and smooth. Pricy for what you get but a decent travel set.",4
"I like the red color. It is rich with a vintage feel. A small amount of product comes in a metal tube. There is a leaflet with directions in which they say to use over lip balm. They are not kidding. Although it goes on smooth and creamy it is very drying. The velvet finish is nice but it dries slowly, smudges and transfers. It does not withstand eating and drinking. But my main objection is that it is very drying. My lips felt dry and parched, a little less so after using lip balm.",3
"I have fine color treated  shoulder length hair. This wand is amazing. There is a good range of temperature and a bright LED read out. It warms quickly. Easy to use it creates shiny, healthy looking, long lasting curls. I use the low range and my hair did not look or feel damaged.  I appreciate the long cord.The one inch barrel is perfect for me. It comes with a carrying case, protective glove and two clips. It does take time to cool off though.",5
"I actually like the small size of this curling iron. It gets hot quickly and the temperature is not adjustable. I have fine, color treated hair so using heat protective product is a must with this. It is pretty easy to use. The curls are more like retro style waves. They last a most a day. It is lightweight and ideal for travel.",4
"I really like these velvet hair bands. They are stylish and the buttons are positioned perfectly. They hold my mask securely without slipping or aggravating my ears. There is a nice variety of two leopards and three neutrals, cream, black and gray. It was supposed to be a six pack but I only received five. Mine also were not as wide as depicted. But that being said they are a fashion forward way to keep hair and masks in place.",4
"With all the mandatory mask-wearing, attention is on the eyes. These lashes are e4asys to apply. The lashes themselves are quite nice and there is a variety that will fit the mood and occasion, from daytime to date night.  If you are adept with liquid eyeliner you will have no problem with the liner. It takes a little practice but once mastered the lashes stay in place. They don't look or feel any different than the usual false lashes. I like them.",5
"These nicely made lashes add drama. Perfect  for special occasions they have length and volume. The black band is flexible. My own lashes are rather sparse so these make a big (and wonderful) difference. But I need something less dramatic for daily use. These are good, reusable, and comfortable on. The glue is NOT included.",4
Like most of these product it is a tad fussy and messy. Practice definitely makes perfect and less is more. the dark brown color is pretty good. If you sprinkle it too thickly it looks artificial. It does give the appearance of fuller hair and masks bare scalp to some extent. the fibers need hair to adhere to so it will be of  no use to those who are bald. I tried it without any spray or holding solution. It adhered fine. The dry particles do brush off without staining. It doesn't run down your face if you sweat but removes easily with shampoo. There is definitely a learning curve to application and it is important to get a close match to your natural color. 3.5,4
"this leave in conditioner is easy to use. sprayed on damp hair, it is an effective detangler. sprayed on both dry and damp hair, it does provide some softness and moisture to dry, over processed hair. My hair is fine and color treated and is frequently subjected to heat from dryers and curling irons. This did leave it feeling soft and looking healthy. However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free. I appreciate the exclusion of mineral oil, petrolaltum or artificial coloring. It is an effective product that provides relief to stressed locks.",4
"As usual my hairdresser left me in the lurch and cancelled my touch up.  I was not happy as I was leaving for a trip with some important meetings the next day.  I could live without the cut but not the roots.  In desperation I purchased this product and boy was I pleased. The kit comes with directions, the usual skimpy gloves, a small bottle of color and activator.  It mixes easily.  The sponge applicator provides good control.  The product sits for ten minutes (fifteen if you have hard to color hair or alot of gray), rinse out, shampoo and style. Initially I was concerned that the color was too dark but it was great, blended beautifully with my expensive salon color.  It looked as good as what I get at the salon and without the attitude and expense. Recommended.",5
This item I have been using it doesn’t work at all,1
My lashes have thinned as I got older. I hoped these would be the solution. I could not get them to stay on my lashes. Perhaps these are best with thicker lashes.,3
"I've purchased this produce several times.  I like it b/c the head is attached; the other one I used to buy, the head would go flying off.  I like the massage side as well.",5
"My hands and arms are bathed in this deep cream. My skin is so soft. The scent lasted until I showered. I have very sensitive skin, but this body butter is great for my entire body, even my face. So many people ask what I'm wearing - I say Aging Hippie :-)  V",5
I fell in love with this brand at a trade show for skincare. I love how I can dissolve these and when you’re don’t you barely have any granules left to clean off of the skin leaving you with a no mess no fuss soft hydrated smooth surface,5
This is wonderful because now I can’t forget to empty and clean my quats at night! I took one star away because mine tends to catch on one corner of the inside tray when I go to shut the lid and I have to open and close it about 2-3 times to get it to release and close evenly. Maybe just a product defect in mine?,4
"The wig was okay the first day. The knots bleached well , and the lace blended perfectly. The only down side to the wig is sheds sooooo much , like this a wig you can only wear one time and take it off , it was cute though",3
LOVE IT...Works just a well at the Expensive ones!!,5
Perfect...they looked Great,5
This “neutral” color works for me with my auburn hair and also works for my daughter with dark brown and the one with dark blonde hair. It lasts a long time too!,4
Quick delivery.  My second bottle.  Makes me feel better.,5
You get what you pay far.. I wanted to wait to review this product because I wasn't sure if the first few were the &#34;bad ones out the bunch&#34; but they all pretty much suck.. I have THIN lashes.. and these don't help and you can't tell which belong on which eye for SOME of them.. they are SUPPOSE to go from small to large but it's just big to big,2
and it is still healing 2 weeks later.  Returned this product for a full refund.,1
"Fresh, cleans well . . . but Amazon is asking twice the normal price of $60.00 for 3.4 oz. elsewhere.",5
Now this is what my hair hydration therapy lives for! This by far the best of Mango Butter....I just wish that had the supply before I ordered from the other supplier and now my hair hates me😭.... please let me know when supply is back♥️,5
This product is lightweight and goes on smoothly without being greasy or caked-up on your face. No scent and a very reasonable price.<br /><br />Problem is I can’t find it on Amazon any more. This is a bummer.  Please bring it back!,5
It was too small for me and pushed my ears out uncomfortably because it was so tight. Didn’t think my head/face was so big. Sent it back.,1
"This is my second purchase and I can't say enough about how simple & effective this gizmo is at getting little food particles my toothbrush misses. It's more fun than flossing and works just as well.<br /><br />No batteries or electricity. I fill it up with a combination of mouthwash and water and am amazed at how efficiently it works. It's so good that I keep the second one at work for when I get back from lunch.<br /><br />My biggest suggestion though is to buy one for the kids. They will love using this little &#34;toy&#34; before realizing that it's doing something good for them. And filling it with plain old water will do just fine, too.",5
"I have been a huge fan of the relatively inexpensive, paperish, hugely saturated facial masks by companies like My Beauty Diary and others ( you can find my many positive reviews) until stumbling upon these lacey, saturated, fantastic masks.<br /><br />I really can't contribute more than other outstanding reviewers have elaborated on the technical advantages of these lacey versions compared to the paper ones except to say how wonderful it is to position the mask over your face and neck and then be able to gently secure it by pulling it over your ears. Genious. The paper masks were good except the chin area never stays in place and I'm always checking to make sure the rest of it hasn't slid around on my face.<br /><br />These cost a little more but the results were so great after my first one, I immediately purchased 3 more boxes of this version and another one to try out.<br /><br />I am way past 50, but my skin looks terrific. Smooth, soft, healthy and glowing. I could not be happier. Go ahead and give these a try. But you better hurry before I buy them all up.",5
Nice!,5
Just what I wanted. Way cheaper then the last one I bought at Walmart.,5
Fits perfect. Easy to put on. Only thing wrong is it cracked while putting a case on the phone.,3
I use it every day It really tone up my skin and so moisture.,5
Excellent Product,5
Too large.,1
"I like these but it is a little yellow, I used my purple shampoo on them and got them to the color I needed to blend in with my hair.",4
"sprayers do not work, very long tube",1
Great product,5
Top heavy.  Some “teeth” are not strong enough for severe tangle removal.,5
"The core where hair is wrapped holds its shape, top soft  rubber cap folds down over the core, holding the hair in place.  Easy to use and wash.",5
The plastic pins to hold rollers in hair are just fine.,5
Just wish the band was a little larger.  Good quality product that arrived as promised.,4
"Ordered for my Halloween costume, they fit pretty good and I have chubby fingers lol",4
Don’t waste your money ... these are terrible .. they don’t stick well at all,1
Noticed the difference in my hair the first time I used it and it just keeps getting better and better after every use. I’m getting compliments every day and everyone wants to know what I’m using on my hair because it looks so healthy!  a little pricey but worth it,5
Just love them they match my own lashes and are easy to put on and remove. They are great too and fun to wear.,5
"Came with a cap to put over your real hair. Looks exactly as advertised. It was purchased for Halloween, wouldn't consider wearing  it for anything other than that.",5
Ripped out my hair from the ROOTS when I tried to remove them.  I'm not exaggerating.  Use at risk !,1
WONDERFUL !  So nice not to suck in material while breathing in.  Lots more air to breath. I have COPD and it's a great invention when you need air.,5
"Frustrating to use, hard to see when braiding. Think you’re  better off learning French braid.",2
As described,3
"always used Max Factor!  Great coverage, soft on skin.",5
"I have used this Perfect Formula Gel Coat for a number of years and really like the product.  My nails break easily, and this helps.  I especially like the pale pink.  It looks lovely on.",4
"made well,works great,good value.",5
I love this kit. It has everything you can possibly need and then some. Great quality for the price as well and the case isn't a cheapo like I thought it would be.,5
keeps skin soft and not greasy,5
"Exactly what I needed for my business.  Great price, fast shipping.",5
"This works very well, not like any kitchen tool I have, but I love it.",5
"New to this brand and love it.  I do wish the brush were a little bigger as my nails are big.  Not too thick, not too thin.  Really like the color changing.",5
"Very nice to use. I wish I had started taking care of my skin when I was younger. I’m pushing 40 and have never used sunblock on my face, etc. I started skin care 6 months ago and it’s been amazing. Adding this tool helps and it just feels nice! I have several different face massagers and I always go back to these types of rollers.",5
They’re great for using with castor oil to apply to brows and lashes. I also use them to brush brows before applying brow makeup.,5
I have sensitive skin. This has a smell to it (it's not a bad smell) so if you're sensitive to smells. It feels nice and moisturizing. It did burn a little but I think it's because I've been trying too many facial products! Will update if it ends up being too bad or REALLY good!,4
Feels cheap and it started to fall apart. Loose parts. Doesn’t cut well. I haven’t used everything but the clippers and do far 1 cane apart & I had to put back together and the slanted tip one didn’t cut my thin nails. I ended up grabbing the kids baby cutters.,1
Really like this mat. Very sturdy and heavy and we'll made. Works great with any hot tool I put on it. Top notch protection for whatever you need to rest your hot irons on.,5
"No ball tips to collect trap lint on the brush.  This brush works great, and it is so easy to clean.  Wonderful design.",5
"If you want a longer lashes look without the ""whoa! she's wearing lashes"" look from everyone who sees you... these are your best bet. Easy to apply and look nice & natural.",4
great gifts,5
These tips are better than what is given in the nail salon. Makes your acrylic tips look more natural. Would Recommend this product.,5
"Photo should say it all.  I received a jar that has already been opened, lid is dented in more than 6 places, label is worn like it's been around the world a few times.",1
"I love this product.  It goes on thin and a little goes a long way.  It’s not thick and goopy like other tanning lotions.  It smells fantastic, and putting it on is refreshing.  Already had a base tan, and only tanned 2x with it so still unsure of the tanning benefits.  But it still smells wonderful after tanning.  If you’re looking for a lotion that has light fragrance, this isn’t for you.  But for those of you who LIKE fragrance, I wish I could find a perfume like this.",5
I have a cosmetology license but I am also frugal. Purchased this to apply my own eyelash extensions and it worked great. I will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I do not recommend applying it to yourself though. It is difficult and you can damage your eyelashes if done incorrectly. The glue also burns your eyeballs.,5
product was not extra strength,4
not too impressed,3
easy to use.  Hits all my target points and feels really good.  It would be better if they provided a human to do it for me.  lol  Now just gotta work out my knots on my own.,5
I have 3 dogs that are all different sizes and this pack provided for all of them,5
Not only a great value but also a nice set all together. I only gave 4 stars because the case doesn't close real well,4
"I like the shiny colors, and it's something a little different from the sparkly polishes.",5
Love the color and the texture.  It goes on smoothly.  Best I have found so far.  Am looking to purchase again in another color,5
it is exactly what i wanted,5
Really cute on,4
Good product,5
Wish the razor came out further. Would work much better. Is okay.,3
Met my expectation<br /><br />Grade: A-,5
"Very, very little foam on small roller- useless!!  not worth 100 at thrift store-!",1
I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE PUFFY EYES THAT I HAVE IN THE MORNING BUT I DIDN'T REALLY SEE MUCH OF A CHANGE,4
There were no instructions and it was noted that it was supposed to come with free serum by going to the website and I did go to the website but I found no way to contact them to get in touch with anyone.  I am not pleased,1
I love this comb. It's sturdy and gently glides through your hair gently and detangle as well.,5
Never used false eyelashes before so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I am loving these eye lashes. May use these for awhile before I upgrade,5
Great product.  Effective and comfortable,5
"Right size, work well. Happy I got them",3
"Score! Finally found something that makes my skin glow and look smoother than ever.<br />I put this on every day before anything else and I truly have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. As we get older, I know in my case at least, skin becomes more dull. This helps to brighten and I really feel like it has made a difference.<br />Now I know I can spend 100 - 200 bucks at any department store makeup counter  and get didn't care products that make a difference and work. But why pay those prices when I can come to Amazon and get something less expensive that works just as well, if not better?<br /> I am less into name brands and more into results. And this helped produce results. As a bonus,<br />I even got to buy this hyaluronic acid at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5
"We have been having such fun since receiving this wig! My daughter has long, dark blond hair, but she wanted to go out one night looking like a character from her favorite TV show. We received the light blonde wig and in minutes, she had long, white-blonde hair that was straight on top and had curls towards the bottom! This wig’s construction is terrific, and it is adjustable.<br />This wig It is made of pretty soft fibers, and you can run your hands over the hair, brush it gently and feel the softness, It has a top tie- on to secure the wig, and the cap lets your scalp breathe. Since it is a rally long haired wig, it is not going to be lightweight: but it doesn’t feel heavy on your head. The color is a white/blonde like just like the TV character and the braids on top can be kept, re-braided or let loose to change the style. And although I was able to purchase this wig at a big discount in exchange for my honest review (and my stars cannot be bought, folks, this is truly my unbiased and honest opinion), I think these prices are completely reasonable and I will be buying more for events where my daughter or I need a different  look. Go ahead and try this company’s wigs! Have fun with it! We are!",5
They are great! Best ones I found so far,5
Nice and big. Used on my Thank you card envelope closure.,5
Works well for my sew in extensions. Adds shine and detangles even long thick hair.,5
"I love this moisturizer! I've been using it for about a year now and it definitely helps brighten and even your skin tone. You have to remember to wear sunscreen because it does make you a lot more sensitive to the sun, but it's worth it. I was getting rough bumpy patches on the back of my upper arms and the back of my legs and this helps smooth out the skin in those areas. I only need to use it about 3 times a week to maintain a healthy glow so the bottle lasts for a while. I use my regular moisturizer on my off days. In the winter when my skin is super dry I Iayer it under my regular moisturizer to maintain the brightening effect. Great price too when you compare it to other products with a AHA % in the same range.",5
"I had been using the foaming cleanser & the AO spray for a while, those are great. I needed a moisturizer that wasn’t greasy and I thought I’d try this. Wow. Just wow. It’s fragrance free and non greasy. Also super fast absorbing. All the things I wanted & needed. I wont ever be without this again, it’s wonderful!",5
Great device - just be careful using. This is really well made.,5
"What? I thought this looked weird & fun and I love to try new products, so I purchased this. It did take a while to get here but this stuff is worth every penny and every day you wait for it to arrive!! Whoah. My face is so clean and smooth, I can’t believe it. I cleanse my face first and hen use this as a toner/second swoop to get the rest of the mascara & makeup off. I thought my face was getting clean by cleansing but this stuff finds dirt & makeup you can’t even see. I couldnt love this more. Glad there were 2 in the package so I won’t run out anytime soon. Will definitely order again & again! Awesome product!",5
"These are weird. It is definitely like having your hair wrapped in a phone cord. It did make my ponytail a little thicker, though. I don't really love these, though. I won't buy them again. They don't stay as well as other holders.",2
As described. Does the job. Packaged well.,5
This is about the third time I have ordered this type of rollers and each time they were too small until now. These are perfect!!!,5
I love to have these for house guests that way the can use their own while they are here and a small something to take home.,5
"I have gotten several different perfumes hopefully I will find my perfect match, but this wasn't it.",3
This is fantastic! I use an inhaler that gives me thrush and this is the only tounge brush that's ever come close to working. It does a great job in seconds.,5
I Love the quality/value of this product !!! I have curly hair and I have been using it for exactly 30 years :) !!!. Yes… I was 20 when I found it. Not used anything else since !,5
Nice,3
"Bath Roman is my favorite series of bath salt from Japan.  This particular scent is not floral or too romantic, but it makes you feel like you were submerged into the pile of scented shredded woods. It turns water into orange-yellow and this calming woody scent immediately takes over the entire bathroom.  So relaxing.  The scent is good for both men and women, and it does not remain on your body as long as the other floral varieties.<br />I take night bath, and it makes my bed smells wonderful and keeps me warm until I fall asleep.  A great way to end my day.",5
"These rubber parts are firm and hold their shape well for a long time. The cheaper kind of replacement rubbers from other brands gets midline slits lengthwise easily after a while, but these are a lot tougher and last for quite long time. Thanks.",5
"First of all, it is small and so cute! Perfect for a small area like my bathroom. BUT, I couldn't get it to work. I have read the instructions over and over again, tried different locations - even tried to plug it into the computer as suggested in instructions. What am I doing wrong?",1
My absolute favorite hair tint color that I have ever used!,5
Love what it does.. Adds curls and some volume and hair won’t tangle. I think you will love it mainly because it works and easy to use.,5
Perfect for a weekend in Vegas,5
"I love the smell of these, and it gets all my make up off. The reason I gave it four stars is because the make up wipes tear very easily so do not rub hard. Also it leaves behind little string pieces in your eyelashes that then get in your eye. They're very thin so it's hard to see them.",4
The bottles work fine but one of the straws came short. So I can’t use one of my bottles and decided to throw it away but overall everything was great.,4
Looked super cheap and fake,1
a great value. They get the shampoo down to the skin and get excess hair and debris,5
great value,5
"I think these are a great idea.  I need to practice more with it and adjust the size of the lashes.  My initial attempts were a little messy and it is strange having the weight on your lids.  I never could get the hang of the glue on lashes, so I was hoping these were easier.  If you regularly use liquid liner, these will be easy for you to use.  The hardest part is getting the liner on smooth and straight.  Once it is on, the lashes stick very well to the magnetic bits in the liner.  Also, they come off fairly easily when pulled.  Potentially, it means you could accidentally pull them off if you play with your lashes or rub your eyes.  But they do stay on well, without touching.<br /><br />The lashes are a standard length, so if your eyes are smaller or larger than standard, you may have to adjust - more for smaller than larger.  If you've never worn lashes but have always wanted to try, this is a good way to start.",5
"I like this brush.  It is very stiff, but massages your scalp while brushing.  I really feel the nylon bristles more than the boar bristles.  Truthfully, I can't say there are any boar bristles.  But is has nice cushioning and is a typical paddle style brush and seems well made.<br /><br />The rubber base the the brush does have the rubber odor that will hopefully go away soon.",4
"Okay, it is a salt scrub. They all pretty much work the same.  Use in the shower, salt dissolves when the water hits it making it easy to clean up compared to other non-salt scrubs.  A bit of oil to moisturize your skin leaving it soft after.<br /><br />I did love the smell of this one.  It is a little strong, so if you have allergies, you may want to skip it.  Some fragrances do bother me, but this one didn't.  It was a fresh floral scent",5
Need a few coats for the black to show up. But the sparkles are plenty. Because of the glitter a little extra effort is needed to remove polish.,5
I had more hope for this product. Been usually faithfully yet zero results. Yes it’s easy to use but I had hoped to see some growth by now. Guess I’ll need to buy a more expensive product.,2
awesome,5
Can’t live without it! Gums are so much healthier,5
Cream is nice but not as effective in developing waves and curls that I have used in past. Would not order again.,3
"Received ours today and cannot say I like it, will probably not give it as a gift.  Cannot say they don't look entirely like the photo, but perhaps are bigger than I thought or saw, are more painted gold look, and ultimately do not look like honey bees which was the intention (I see it was not advertised as such).  I know they are cheap so not too much complaint, I just had hoped for more.",2
"NAIL MAGIC WORKERS! This is the Natural Matte finish you may be looking for!! I take a lot of vitamins..  I can not grow nails! Have this one in your kit in case a guy like me comes in for Gel extensions on the guitar strumming side and short Gel coating on the two that split down the middle from fretboard pressure (left hand), and I don't want ANY shine. This is the natural top coat I've been looking for. I have tried every fingerpick and thumb pick on the market. NOTHING beats a real nail.. a Gel nail is second. I hope they never stop making this it is AMAZING!",5
Well made set and you get a lot for the price! Great quality! Great for gel extentions.,5
Great little tools to keep my brushes clean. And no color transfers. Best price too!,4
You have to hold it for a long time and its really hot,4
Very nice and secure .. Works great for me .. Thanks for a great product,5
"I love that I can wash & dry these with the hand soap on my counter after each use.  Makes me feel much better than with the sponges - the repeated washings, the discoloration, the worry about germs & bacteria, & the expensive cleaners.<br />I have no real skill when it comes to makeup application, but even I couldn't mess this up.  Anything I could apply with my fingers (concealer, foundation, creams, etc), I can apply with these AND there's ZERO product absorbed or wasted.",5
This stuff did a great job restoring a faded leather chair. It made lots of cat claw scratches disappear. I wish it made my cat disappear.,5
Perfect quality. Gorgeous color. I'm a lifelong customer and I will always want this color. Its like vranberry.,4
"Pretty, darker than 178 Lady Godiva and has sparkles.",4
Every one that try’s this loves how it leaves your hair.,5
You do not need a Yeti.  Gus is fabulous.  Keeps my drink cold for 24hrs (sometimes I still have ice at hour 23).,5
Love this brand. Both sprays and candles!,5
"The wig is nice and soft.  I bought it for a costume party, so I didn't need it to be totally realistic, which is lucky for me since the wig has big, white stripes right in the front.  It looks like a tiger.  Since it was for a gold-themed costume party, I was able to put gold eyeshadow in the white stripes and spray the wig with gold glitter to &#34;fix&#34; it.",3
Excellent,5
"This product comes in a glass bottle with a pump dispenser. The dispenser has a very small spout, making it difficult to dispense the product without having it run down the side of the bottle. Note that there is oil in the name - it feels like an oil and goes on like an oil, with no foaming or cleansing at all. It also has a strong scent of lavender (which I like, but others may not).<br /><br />This product works well as a remover for eye makeup. However, I don't feel that it does a good job of cleansing my face overall. Although the product rinses clean and leaves my face feeling soft, my face doesn't feel clean, and I feel the need to use an actual cleanser after. I would recommend this product as a eye makeup remover only and would suggest that ""cleanser"" be removed from the name.",3
"This is a red lipstick in an attractive case. I don't wear a lot of red, as so many of the red lipsticks turn orange-y on me, but this one appeared more blue-based, so I decided to try it. It goes on smoothly and has decent staying power. It does seem to have more blue undertones than some I've tried. However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue. This is not bad if that's what you want; just be aware that your personal result might vary from what is pictured.",4
"I was looking for something to help with my dark undereye patches and to generally revive my eyes. I have used these twice now around the holidays when I've been worn out. These comma-shaped masks are easy enough to apply - there is a little spatula thing to help lift them out in order to be sanitary. They have a wet, silicone-like feel that is very similar to the feel of a contact lens, only thicker. I found that they stuck to my skin fairly well, even when I was moving around. The mask felt nice on and was a bit cooling after awhile. The area under my eyes felt refreshed after using these, although I didn't actually notice anything visibly different. These might be worth it if you are simply looking to make your eye area feel better.",4
"I recently started using this product in the shower.  It has a nice gel-like consistency and lathers easily.  The fragrance is a strong cucumber scent, which I didn't like, but luckily it faded quickly.  Overall, this performs well for cleaning the face and leaving it feeling fresh, but it is not a particularly remarkable or different product.",4
"I love trying different lotions, particularly those that have nice fragrance, but when I received this set, I almost threw it away!  I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The ""lotion"" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (""Jam Blaster"") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.",3
"This matte lipcolor pencil goes on nice and smooth.  It doesn't dry my lips like some other products.  The color is a deep plum, although very natural rather than intense.  I would recommend this.",4
"I have been using this product for several weeks now.  I choose the option for the ""mascara brush"" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.",4
"This lipstick set comes in 2 sets of 5, Set A and Set B.  I wound up only opening the ""A"" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the ""B"" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is ""Almost Friday,"" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept ""Blush for Me,"" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, ""Red for Me,"" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.  This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying.",3
"I was hoping that since this is labelled ""regular"" polish remover that it might work better than some that are labelled ""gentle,"" which I've found don't work as well.  I tried this on removing polish from my toenails; generally this is a more stubborn area for polish removal.  It worked okay, but no better than other removers I have tried.  I will use this but I won't repurchase.",4
"My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.",5
"NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.<br /><br />Like the hair on my head, my eyelashes are thin and fine.  Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.",3
"After very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.",4
"I’ve ordered these hoses before and not had the current problem, so I don’t know what’s up, but the hose I just installed is almost unusable. I need oxygen with my Bipap, but every time I breathe in at night I get a nose full of some nasty chemical smell. It’s bad enough that I’m worried it will make my asthma worse. It’s so vile I’ve even seriously considered washing the hose out, despite knowing that’s a bad plan. I won’t order again if the other hoses I ordered at the same time have the same stench.",3
Scent was good but the roller ball in the roll on applicator bottle fell out almost immediately. I've tried putting it back in but it doesn't stay. Would not recommend,2
Wow! So many gems for such a great price!,5
Such a good idea...great for pedicures and protecting/moisturizing heels. Great quality also. Liked so much bought more for myself and gifts.,5
Works as intended,5
Good quality,5
Great Transaction and exactly as described.,5
These work perfectly.  I even have a &#34;murder's thumb&#34; (toe thumb if you will like Megan Fox) and these still fit.  Wonderful for stamping and have extra ones for common sizes (Like one of my hands is two 5's.),5
"Update: waaaay too thin!!! Wouldn't repurchase. Break easily.<br />Whatever, they're rubber bands... thinner than I like... but they're okay. Wouldn't buy again just as I prefer much thicker nylon stocking type band - less hair crimping but good hold. I'm going to stick with those from now on, but it's personal preference. A decent product.",2
"I love the lemon sage scent. The Shampoo and Conditioner work well. Not the best I have ever used, but close. Would buy again.",4
"You get a good amount for the price, and a little really goes a long way, so this is very good value.  As they say, it's unscented (I've found not every ""unscented"" product truly is), which I prefer. Covers well. A little more liquid than some others, but certainly not in any problematic sense. Comes with an eye dropper, which makes it easy not to overuse. Good product.",4
"This is a nice irrigator that isn’t as bulky as some but not as slim as some travel ones, so best for home use<br /><br />Rechargeable battery lasts a long time for usage, and holds its charge for good amount if not used daily<br /><br />Good variety of modes in terms of intensity and pulse. Modes are noticeably different, which isn’t always the case in Some of these<br /><br />High intensity isn’t painful, as has been the case on others I’ve used<br /><br />Easily maneuverable, light<br /><br />Very pleased",5
Affordable and useful.,5
"I love Moroccanoil products. I have their full size Color Care Conditioner but this one I ordered is the deluxe travel size - TSA friendly and easy to pack for travel, but the amount is not a lot and you will use this up easily if you wash your hair frequently. The price is high for the amount so it's not a great value - I would just purchase the large size and transfer some to an empty 3 or 4 oz bottle so you can get it through airport security.",4
"This cream feels great on my skin and is readily absorbed but I have been using it for months now and haven't seen any ""firming"" effect. For the current price it's too high for what it does - which is being an effective moisturizer. There are many products out there that hydrate your skin - I usually prefer olive oil-based products. This one doesn't change the sagginess around my neck so only three stars from me!",3
"This is more like a gimmick than a functional ""nail dust"" vacuum. I was hoping I could use this mini vacuum for cleaning up crumbs as well. It runs on batteries but the suction level is average and I have to go over the space with the vacuum several times before it picks up anything. The idea is good only if it has strong power but you can tell it's cheaply made. Another item for the landfill, thanks AOERM (yet another meaningless and unpronounceable brand name from the land of junk)",2
"I think this set would make a nice present for a teenage girl. It comes with a makeup mirror, cosmetic gift bag and ceramic dish that you can use to hold jewelry. The design is rather simplistic but the quality is good for this sort of thing. It's like those items you might find at TJ Maxx. I think the price is a little high for what it is - it's not bad but not great either. It would make a good goody bag item but I wouldn't spend too much for it.",4
This is a generic but smooth working jade roller. It feels even better if you put it in the fridge first - the cooling sensation is quite refreshing in the morning. It's fairly well made and doesn't squeak. Overall it's good for the price.,4
"This is a DIY clay mask kit that could use better branded packaging. It comes in a generic box with everything tossed into it, which makes it feel like a random assortment of products rather than a unified kit. It includes two different but reputable brands (Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and an Indian Clay Mask) as well as an assortment of mixing supplies (pink bowl, measuring spoons, spatula, brush). The pink plastic supplies are dollar quality and feel very cheap while the ACV and clay mask are full size products that can be used together as indicated on the DIY recipe or on their own. The mask jar doesn't specify that ACV must be used so I assume you can use it on your own or have it diluted with water. The ACV can be used for many other applications including drinking for general health.<br /><br />Overall I like the quality of the two products - the other supplies felt unnecessary and extraneous, but I guess you can charge more by including them. But I'd rather just use my own bowls. Overall it's a good quality kit and it gives you a nice at-home facial. I tried it once and my skin does look brighter than usual. However, they warn you not to leave it on for more than 5-10 minutes as it can irritate your skin.",4
"Sand & Sky makes great products. It's only natural that they should extend their skincare line with this massage tool. I own many quartz facial rollers but this one is high quality and well-made. It works similar to the ReFa carat tool but without the high price tag. It pinches your skin a bit when you roll it but that's necessary to improve skin circulation. In addition to anti-aging benefits, it's also great for smoothing out any moisturizer or makeup foundation you've applied and prevents caking. Overall it's a great tool and I love using mine with Sand & Sky gels and moisturizers.",5
"I've never heard of this brand before but it goes on easily and doesn't leave any white residue. A little goes a long way - a good thing given the eye popping price being charged for this. The sunscreen has protected my face well but so do many cheaper alternatives - I'd prefer to splurge on other things rather than sunscreen. But if you can afford it, it's a good product.",4
"The Isa Lazo Body Scrub comes in a heavy round jar. The outside of the jar was somewhat sticky so I wasn't happy about the way it was packaged - it should be in a bag of some sort to prevent leaks.<br /><br />Except for that, this scrub has a pleasant, relaxing scent. It consists of coffee colored crystals. You get a lot - about 8.8 ounces worth. I rubbed it on my legs and under the soles of my feet. There is a slight oiliness to the scrub that you often don't get from other scrubs - it's probably from the essential oils. After rinsing it off, I felt my dry skin feel much softer and hydrated. It really provides a nice semi-spa experience.<br /><br />The price, however, is off the charts. I've used many scrubs and I'm not sure this one is worth the cost. The ingredients seem to be of high quality, though, so if you can afford it, indulge!",4
"This ""freckle pen"" is like a magic marker for your face. This set of two includes a light brown and a darker brown pen. The tip is wider than I would have liked but it's effective at creating small freckles as long as you dab it on your face lightly. I jumped into the pool with a few freckle spots and it didn't wash off, which is nice. Overall it's good, works as described and didn't irritate my face.",4
"These are very small towelettes that come in a small sealed packet. It's perfect for travel given its small size but I needed at least 2 towelettes to wipe down my entire face. That means it will be used up very quickly so the value is average. The towelettes aren't particularly strong either - I tore one just pulling it out of the package. There is also no alcohol in the formula so it's best used for wiping your face rather than disinfecting your hands - for that you're better off using something with alcohol in it to kill the germs. As a result, this bundle of towelettes has limited usefulness - it's good for a light face cleaning or to finish the job left by a facial cleanser.<br /><br />I like the fact that it's paraben free and has no scent to irritate my allergies. Overall it's good but not great.",4
"This is a decent rose quartz roller and gua sha stone. The quality is pretty good, on par with similar sets I've ordered. The rose gold hardware is attractive and the roller doesn't make a squeaking sound as you roll it across your face, unlike some of the lower quality sets I've seen. The gua sha stone isn't perfect (it has several small nicks across its surface) but since you use the edges of the stone and not the middle, it doesn't affect the function. Overall I like the quality of this set. It comes in a generic box (there are so many of these), but is ready for gift giving.",5
"I love the graphics on the outside box - most gua sha and rose quartz roller sets come in plain, generic packaging and this one is pretty enough to gift. Unfortunately, when I opened my box I was stunned to find that the Gua Sha stone was cracked in half, even though it was nestled in the box! Either this happened at the factory and the stone was still sent to me damaged, or it happened during shipping. However, most sets I've received that are presented in the same manner arrive in perfect condition. Not sure what happened but I'm disappointed, as I could tell it was a really nice stone.",3
"I ordered #27 but they look darker than I expected. It was described as ""ombre blonde"" but it's not that much lighter than the Natural Black. Despite this, these extensions are very soft and easy to install. It comes with a crochet hook with some hair jewelry. The quality of the hair is OK, I just wish the description of the shade was more accurate.",4
"This set reminds me of one of the ""subscription boxes"" that are sent out every month or quarterly. Everything in it is geared toward a theme - mindfulness, stress relief and relaxation. The sizes are all small - the shower gel, the candle, the pillow spray, the roll on. It's a small, thoughtful box for someone who needs some downtime. The candle smells great and is small enough to take with you on a trip. The other items are TSA friendly. Overall this is a pleasant box but I felt the price was way too high - for that price, I feel it should have included an additional item, like a white noise machine, sleep mask or some other stress relief item.",5
"This comb is made with thick wood - while it's not heavy (it's surprisingly lightweight), it's chief disadvantage is that it takes up more room in a drawer. I'm not sure what is to be gained by its thickness (the teeth, after all, are normal) other than to exaggerate the fact that it's made of wood. I think it's made to be more of a display piece than a functional one, so if you have space to display it on a dresser table, it's certainly worthy of that. It has a nice design and comes across as well made. In the end, however, it's just a comb and while I appreciate its decorativeness, it's one of that space hogging pretty things that make sense only if you like displaying beautiful things.",5
"I've seen so many of these jade roller/rose quartz sets and they all look the same except for the prices. This one is a good set to give as a gift because it's larger and nicer than some of the more chintzy sets. It comes with not only the usual rose quartz roller with the questionably useful Gua Sha stone (personally I found it useless for skin issues but they nevertheless include it in all these sets) but a small roller, which you almost never see anywhere. It's the perfect size for travelling and works just as well as the larger version.<br /><br />However, the larger roller has spikes on one end, which I don't like at all and which they had kept the usual smooth end. It seems made for microdermabrasion which is painful to use and which I don't believe works at all for beautifying your face, only hurting it. Except for this, I like this set.",5
"I've never heard of this brand before but the price is high and it's considered a premium beauty product, made in Korea. The question is, it is worth the price?<br /><br />First, kudos to the packaging. The Glam Pearl Radiance Capsule serum is full of pearls (whether they are real or not is unclear). The bottle is filled with tiny ""pearls"" suspended in a gel solution that reminds me of bubble tea. The serum that comes out is supposedly infused with fermented pearl extract. In Asia, eternal beauty is often represented by pearls and so they're attributed with some mystical powers of youthful rejuvenation and powers of preservation. So it goes with this serum - the lotion has a shimmering effect mimicking that of pearls. It is very smooth and creamy, and leaves my skin glowing.<br /><br />Whether this serum has actual anti-aging effects is questionable. My wrinkles haven't gone away at all. I've been using it only a few weeks and will update my review if I see any significant change to my face. As it is, it's a pricey but aesthetically pleasing beauty product that will make you feel like you will get a pearl-like beauty just by using it.",4
"This is a pretty headband with lots of sparkly rhinestones and colorful stones. The embellishments look almost too pretty for a headband and I wish I could remove the stones and make a necklace or brooch out of them. The headband is comfortable to wear though I feel like I'm wearing headphones at times because of its thickness. As it is, the colors are a little garish and over the top, so I wouldn't wear this as a serious wardrobe accessory but rather as a whimsical adornment to a costume or a 1950s style event. I think a teenager would love it.",4
"I'm disappointed in the look of this pink jeweled headband. The crystal beads look cheap and the headband seems made for a teenage girl. I was hoping for sparkly pink rhinestones but they're actually plastic faceted beads, the same kind you'd sew on the cuff of a sweater. They're kind of blah and look chintzy. It comes in a zip loc bag with a dust cloth with the company's unpronounceable name printed on it. Disappointed.",2
"I've reviewed many nail lamps and I like this one because of the color, the ease of operation and how quickly it dries my nails. It has a wide mouth so you can put both hands in if your hands are small and the same goes with your feet.<br />The LED screen is bright and easy to read. It has a strong UV light but you can adjust the speed so you can use just enough to dry your nails (too much may be bad for your hands). Overall it's a decent nail lamp but the price feels a little high for this type of item.",4
"This has a strong scent of mango, which is quite appealing. Outside of that, the body wash doesn't lather that well and the consistency of the wash is on the thin side. It's cleans well but other than the mango scent I wasn't impressed by it. The price isn't too high though it's a rather small bottle. Overall it's OK but I don't love it enough to order it again.",4
I have dry patches on my leg and on the soles of my feet. I love using this sugar polish after a shower and before going to bed - lavendar is my favorite scent and I enjoy inhaling this scent while feeling how soft my legs and feet get after using a few drops of this. I don't use a lot because I want it to last a long time and thankfully a little goes a long way. Love this product!,4
"I was looking forward to getting this, as I love perfume and hoped to use this on a trip. Each towelette is infused with the ""Pinrose"" scent so you can dab it on your neck, arms, and wherever. It's space saving as each sealed packet contains a towelette. It reminds me of what you might get at a hotel. Unfortunately I absolutely hated the scent. It literally made me want to gag. It isn't floral or sweet but some kind of awful chemical smell. This is one of those things you really can't buy online sight unseen, you need to smell it first.",2
"You're getting a set of two shower caps with a leopard print design on them - one that's silver with black leopard prints and the other is the conventional brown with black spots. ach one comes separately sealed in a ziploc bag, so you could easily gift one to a friend if you chose. The caps are on the small side - good for a child and an average adult-sized head but not good if you have a large head.  The price is low but then you get what you are paying for - the quality is average - better than a 99 cent discount store but made of a cheap synthetic fiber that doesn't feel that durable or long term. OK but only moderately better than the throwaway caps you might get at a hotel.",3
"In these COVID times, staying clean is a priority and anything related to soap and sanitation is all the rage. Since I don't travel much anymore, I felt a bit nostalgic when I saw this bag of six soaps. Each one is tear-shaped and about the size of a hotel travel soap. I really like the scent and it lathers well - best of all it's made without the toxic chemicals most mainstream soaps and body washes are filled with. It has a refreshing scent, thanks to being made with essential oils.<br /><br />It's advertised as a soap that ""boosts immunity"" but I find that laughable - everyone is reminded constantly to wash your hands as a way to prevent the spread of COVID and that action, you could say, ""boosts"" your immunity given that COVID is no match for soap. But to say the soap gives you some immunity is a bit of a stretch. Except for this questionable marking slogan, I liked these soaps.",4
"This came with no clear instructions - as a result, I was very reluctant to use it given the danger of burning myself. The instructions were in very small print and there was a chart showing the different levels of heat that you should use depending upon the color of your skin - light, medium, dark. This felt weirdly racist for some reason, perhaps because the writing was so poor. For something that affects your skin I would only use a device like this if the instructions are clearly spelled out.",2
"This black soap bar feels as thick as a brick but feels great on my skin. It's made with activated charcoal and has the coloring of charcoal, but thankfully not the scent! Under a hot shower it releases a nice minty scent and the hardy soap appears to less vulnerable to melting away in the soap dish unlike other softer soaps I've used. It's made for men but I don't see why women can't use it as well, as it's refreshing. It's best used for the face, as it cleans out your pores, but as I wash my face and body in the shower at the same time, it's a perfect face body combination soap.",4
"I have a weakness for beautifully decorated soap bottles. This Bouquet Garni bottle looks great and I'm tempted to use this as a hand soap rather than as a body wash just so I can display it on my sink. As for the scent, ""White Musk"" I don't like it as much. It's OK, but I prefer lavender but thought I'd give it a try. As a wash, it foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and cleansed. It's made in Korea, home to many high qualty skin care companies so I trust its quality (more so than if it's from China!).<br /><br />Again, I love the bottle so I'll be sure to re-use it after the body wash is all gone, but if I had to do it again, I'd choose a different scent. But if you're a white musk fan, go for it!",4
"The only thing I didn't like about this shower ""foam"" is how quickly it will be used up. It comes in a relatively small caninster and it comes out like shaving foam, only it's for the body and not for the face. It feels great and helps clear my stuffed sinuses. The scent is ""mint and rosemary"" but I feel like it's mostly mint. It's a step up above your ordinary shower gel but it won't likely last as long, as it's hard to tell how much of the bottle you are actually using since it's not liquid. Except for that caveat, I liked this.",4
"I usually pack travel size bottles of facial cleanser. This package comes as 20 individually wrapped towelettes, not dissimilar to what you might find in a hotel or airline first class amenity kit. They look like dry wipes but once you add water, it suds up really well and is perfect for washing your face free of makeup. It can also be reused as a regular wipe after the first use, just hang up and let dry. There isn't much of a scent, which is fine by me as strong fragranced wipes are bad for my allergies. Overall a nice product though not the most environmentally friendly with all the packaging.",5
"This ""facial kit"" has all the items you'd expect to get in a spa gift basket, only it's shipped in a cardboard box reminiscent of subscription boxes. The main difference is that it's a one-time deal, no subscription needed, and all the items are grouped together by theme and color. I ordered the ""gold"" theme and was a little disappointed that not all the items are gold colored (the eye mask is blue) and there's a mix of drugstore items with some more luxurious feeling ones.<br /><br />I'll start with the good. The box is very cute, with the words ""It's a great day to love your face"" greeting you when you open the box. Inside you get a five count box of sheet Masks that contain retinol, a generous and thick box of facial wipes, a Gold under-eye pad to reduce lines and puffiness, and a gold Lip Mask (I've never used a ""lip mask"" before so this seems a little bizarre, if fun). The blue eye mask is filled with gel beads so you can use it hot or cold, and the cheapest and least impressive items are the ""facial buff"" (a pear-shaped sponge that looks like something you'd clean your pots with) and a  ""facial cleansing brush"" that looks a little cheap but is nevertheless useful.<br /><br />The main thing that was missing was some packing peanuts or confetti, as the items were tossed into the box hither and thither with NO padding, whereas other gift baskets and boxes typically include some stuffing so that the items are more artfully displayed. This one wasn't, so if I were giving this to someone as a gift, I'd certainly add it so the items wouldn't arrive in a jumble. But otherwise, I liked it.",4
"I already have a number of gel nail polishes but I love the iridescent glitter of these nail polishes. They are very sparkly and the gel lasts a long time. It's a small set so it will be used up fairly quickly. The only thing I didn't like about it was the strong chemical odor of the polish but it dissipates after awhile. Except for this, I love the look of this nail polish.",5
"I love gift sets like these, which are great for sampling expensive beauty products so that you don't waste money on full size products that don't work for your skin. This is the secret behind the success of Ipsy and Birchbox. You get five travel sizes of the most popular and bestselling items sold by Caudalie: an eye cream, radiance serum, moisturizing sorbet, foaming cleanser, and beauty elixer. The eye cream was nice but I didn't see any effect on my wrinkles; the radiance serum made my skin feel great, as did the moisturizing sorbet. I think I liked the cleanser the most and the beauty elixer the least (it didn't do much for me). Considering that each one is costly for a full size version, it's great to be able to know which one is right for me before purchasing. To top it off, it comes in a beige canvas cosmetic travel bag decorated with grapes. Very nice.",4
This is a striking perfume bottle to display on your dresser - the bronze-colored mannequin figure has a sexy pose and you grip her torso when you pick up the bottle to spray. It's a musky scent that lingers for quite awhile. I like the earthiness of the scent and the bottle is great. Very happy.,5
"This flat iron is OK for the price. It heats up quickly, has a number of temperature settings and a pair of heat-resistant gloves. It's pretty lightweight though too big for travel. There is nothing particularly unique about it to distinguish from dozens of similar mass produced models out there so I would go according to price.",4
"My swabs came in a small box and looked less than 200, but it may be just the way the swabs were packed - very tightly and with no outer wrapping. They feel sturdier than the swabs that have plastic handles - I use these to clean my ears but also to dab Listerine along my gumline to help fight gingivitis. It feels solidly made and the swabs are tightly wound rather than soft and flabby like cheaper swabs. Overall I'm happy with these.",5
"My elderly mother in law can't bathe herself without help so these wipes are perfect for when she needs a wipe down and fears getting in the shower. She dislikes the scent (very medicinal) but she feels refreshed after wiping herself with one of these. Each one is individually sealed which is convenient and hygienic, versus those where you have a resealable package and risk drying out the other towels if it's not sealed properly. I will also use these when I go hiking or camping. They are biodegradable so it's also better for the environment. Recommended.",4
"I think it works better as a styling wax - it didn't stiffen my hair as much as I would have liked, but the cream made it a breeze to style. The scent is a little strong but it's pleasant. I think this product could be used by both men and women though it's obviously intended for men. This product is made in England and the graphics are pleasant to look at it - it has a quaint Victorian vibe about it. Overall I'm pleased with the product but the price could be better",4
"It's always a pleasure to get a high quality gift set like this - it has everything you need to maintain and groom your beard along with extras that you can use on a trip. The straightener works well, the scissors are nice and sharp, and there's a rugged travel bag that looks very manly. Very pleased with it.",5
This headband is soft and flexible. It keeps my hair from falling into my eyes when I do my morning routine of washing my face. It's also great for holding your hair back after you shampoo and making it easier to style. It can also be washed after every use and dries quickly because the material isn't too thick. Overall it's of a good quality.,5
"The wipes are great but they are on the small side. Depending on how much makeup you wear on a typical day, you'll need at least two to get all your makeup removed. I reserve one for the eyes and one for the face. So I expect I'll use up this package relatively quickly. It doesn't irritate my face and it doesn't leave my skin dry, which is a plus. So it's all good except for the size of the wipes.",4
"Considering it's low price point, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this set performed on my skin. I have dry patches on my cheeks and the moisturizer worked really well at keeping my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I didn't like the eye serum as much (I didn't see much of a difference) but it didn't irritate my skin so both products are decent for the price.",4
"This is a multi-colored set of travel perfume atomizers. Each one is shaped like a fancy pen or lip gloss, which makes it easy to mistake it for one. However, each one is quite attractive and adds a touch of glamour to your purse. Each slender tube holds quite a bit of perfume. This is ideal for travel and would make a nice gift for the frequent traveler who can't live without her favorite perfumes.",4
"This is a strongly scented mens body wash with notes of ginseng, green tea, menthol and Vitamin B. Caffeine is also listed as an ingredient. The menthol and the ginseng scents overpower the rest. It lathers up very well and imparts a cooling sensation that makes you tingle all over and even clears your sinuses! I would recommend this body wash for people with colds because this really helps. I love it.",5
"This is miles away from the small inflatable bath pillow you see at 99 cent stores. The pillow is huge and provides a lot of support for your head. It's held securely in place by the suction cups.<br /><br />This is a nice gift for anyone who takes a lot of baths. However, if you only do so occasionally, you might find that the size of this pillow might be a deterrent. It's not space saving and does take up a lot of room for storage. That would be my only critique.",4
"UPDATED Review:<br />I took off one star because the tips of my nails turned yellow (and stayed that way for a few days) after using this product. Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be  more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for. But be prepared to use 2 cloths at a time to get it all off, which adds up to only 5 uses.",3
"I just came back from a trip and packed this curling iron in my luggage. It's described as ""travel"" but the length is about the same as other curling irons. The main difference is the weight - it's so light and functions as both a straightener and curler, so it does save space in my luggage. It works very well. I had never heard of this brand before but the curler works just as well as more expensive brands. To change from a curler to a straightener, you simply press the buttons ""S"" for Straightener or ""C"" for Curling! So simple and easy to use.",4
"This is a fun assortment of colorful hair ties with plastic pendants made in the shape of bunnies, starfish, sunflowers, bowties and other cute items. There are small hair clips as well, all of them well organized in a hard plastic box that can be easily reused for other things as the kids get older. Little girls will love the bright pink colors. Recommended.",5
"This mask covers more of the face that similarly styled masks I've seen, including the ones you'd get in a First Class amenity kit. I really like how thick and comfortable it is. Like most masks, it's effective in blocking any and all light that might keep you awake. It's a good size and easy to pack for a trip.",4
"I love the scent of this anti-aging serum but I didn't notice any significant effects on the wrinkle beneath my right eye. In addition, the microbeads don't dissolve easily and I had to rub the serum several times before they were absorbed by my face. I also recently learned microbeads are also bad for the environment because they can poison fish if they're disposed of in drains and end up in the ocean. So I won't be ordering any more products with this ingredient.",2
"Jade facial rollers are everywhere these days and it's hard to find one that stands out among the crowded field of rollers. This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently. I would get it for the roller alone, but the lack of instructions prevent me from giving this set more than three stars.",3
"I like drinking apple cider vinegar but smelling it on my hair is a different story. While the scent dissipates I smell the vinegar when I first spray it on my fine, frizzy hair. The mist seemed to make it a little bit softer and smoother, but not to the point where I'd get this again. I prefer to use other anti-frizz products because I can't get past the slight vinegar smell. Add in the high price and I'm not getting it again.",3
"This flat iron is versatile in that it's effective on dry hair as well as wet - usually I avoid straightening my hair when it's dry out of fear that it will damage my hair. In this case I didn't notice any ill after effects - the Tourmaline Ceramic plates are designed to be softly reactive to your hair, so this may be the reason. The best advice I can give is to be aware of the heat settings - I typically use the lowest and work my way up depending on how my hair reacts.<br /><br />Like most flat irons by Parwin, it heats up fast and has a swivel cord. Given how many flat irons there are on the market, I would say this is OK in terms of what it does for the price. I wouldn't say it was exceptional but I like the versatility of the dry hair option.",4
"This is a gorgeous palette of eyeshadows that range from earth tone colors like sand and tan to red and gold hues characteristic of a sunset (hence the title). Most of them shimmer with glitter, which is really cool - you can mix and match the different colors to get just the right effect. No brush is included but it's easy enough to apply to your eyes with your fingers. The quality is pretty good - I didn't experience any eye irritation when I used this. Very nice gift for yourself or a friend.",5
"This hair trimmer comes with two attachments, a USB charging cord and even a cute little cape with the company's logo for your child to wear while you trim his/her hair. It's small and portable, so you can even take it on a trip. The best thing is that it isn't too noisy so it won't scare your little one. A courtesy card from the company thanking you for purchasing the product even includes a quote about how great mothers are from singer Stevie Wonder!<br /><br />Overall this is a very useful product that will save a parent money from taking your little one to the barber shop or hair salon. It works well and I can't see why it can't be used for an adult's hair as well, though the small size made it clear that is meant for a child's small head.",4
"This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would have been faster.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I like the glossy finish. There hasn't been any serious chipping or loss of polish for a week now, but I've used other gel polishes that have lasted almost as long as the LED kind.  And for those who like to change their polish often, preserving the same look for a week or two isn't a priority. So unlike you already have some sort of LED lamp, I would just stick to the normal gel polishes available out there.",4
"This is a small bottle of powder that comes with a tiny spoon.  You dab a bit of the white powder into your hand and mix it with your regular moisturizer, which you then apply to your face. I used a little water and my usual Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 15 sunblock.  My face does look a little brighter after using it for a week but the effect is somewhat similar to using a light-colored makeup foundation.  Unfortunately it has little effect on my crow's-feet or my small &quot;laugh lines&quot;. It's OK but since I can get the same effect applying certain types of makeup or concealers, it's chief benefit is that it's good to use when you don't want to wear makeup and want something that has a lighter feel on your face. Otherwise, the price is kind of high for what you get.",3
"Etched glass, will last forever. They leave a nice smooth nail. Great deal for the 5 piece set.",5
Absolutely  no  chance  at all!,1
Absolutely  Nothing !,1

This does what it is supposed to do without drying out your hair and leaving it feeling “stripped.” The only drawback is the tube it comes in -you have to be patient and apply lots of pressure to tube to get the shampoo to come out.,5
"Rub a Dub Scrub! A delightful shower treat. This organic body polish is nicely scented with coffee and peppermint. Typically I make my own from organic ingredients, so I am picky and compare. I was very happy with the Alexa coffee body scrub. The package is a nice size at 8 oz. It also would make a wonderful gift if you are needing a quality pampering for someone.<br /><br />You can just get your feet wet if you are doing a pedicure with it. All you have to do is get your body wet, or the particular area you are using it on. I put a smidgen between my fingers and only use it on key body dry areas. If you want to slather it all over that is ok too! I just like to make it last because it is nice on my skin. I have several dry eczema areas and dry areas on my feet.<br /><br />I have used other brands and had to transfer it into another container of my own, I love that with this one I didn't have to! It is not to cumbersome in the shower, the package is easy to open and close. The Alexa brand is made in the USA with organic all natural moisturizers. My skin is soft silky smooth with the combination of the great ingredients of dead sea salt, organic oils, organic coffee and organic shea butter. I used the scrub on my hands, feet, upper arms and legs. The scrub doesn't leave behind an oily residue, just a nice soft skin feeling. It's great for light exfoliating. Scrub, rub and rinse! I received this product at a discount in return for a review and my honest and unbiased opinion.",5
These are fantastic for me to start making my own facial serum and soak these pads in it and apply to my face. They are nice and soft. They are nice and absorbent. I save a lot of money buying these cotton masks and making my own facial ingredients. Plus then I know exactly the quality and what ingredients are being used. You can find alot of great different recipes online to make your own. I am very happy with these and would purchase these again once my supply diminishes.,5
I had never used this particular brand before. I was impressed with the results on my legs and other areas for a wonderful shave. I like this scent.,5
works as expected just to small for our application,3
"It's the best wig (in this price range) I've found so far. After about a month of searching, I've finally found one that is<br />- soft<br />- doesn't tangle<br />- and has a natural color.<br />Unfortunately, it's strong shine and the way the ends curl make it appear incredibly fake in most lights.<br />With that being said, it is possible to style the wig with a flat iron, though I wouldn't go over about 250 degrees--otherwise, it begins to fuzz up.<br />So that takes care of the unnatural curling.<br />For the shine, I tried applying baby power throughout and that helped some, but it still does looks a little too silky smooth (See photos with flash).<br />Note: I did have to cut the bangs; they were about 2 inches too long (better than too short though!).",4
"Things I learned:<br />-DO NOT over massage<br />-Use the cream properly<br />-Use the massager properly<br />-use the cream right after. These products come in a pair for a reason.<br /><br />Alright, I'll get to the point. Does the product do what it says?<br />In so many words, yes, most definitely.<br />My experience with the products was as follows.<br />First, I mistakenly used the cream on my legs during my shower as a way of lubricating the massager.<br /><br />TIP: This is incorrect... I know that now.<br /><br />Luckily, I din't waste much and my experience with the brush was actually really great. Massaging is painless and since its manual, you get to choose the level of pressure you feel you ought to apply.<br />One caveat--do not over rub. I did so and ended up bursting my bum, waking up the following morning with bits of--what I assume was--busted blood cells. I even bruised a bit. Long story short, go easy on yourself and do not massage too often. I would suggest about four times a week as a maximum.<br /><br />The cream itself is nice. I've used it about 5 times now, and I can already so a minor difference. Although I generally attribute this to the massager, the cream does leave the skin feeling tighter for sure. It does remain sticky for a couple of seconds (about 45...less than a minute, not bad) but drys completely.<br /><br />My experience has taught me that, by using the correct products correctly, you can actually get rid of cellulite.<br /><br />Last and final point; I'm not sure how permanent this is, however, massaging and creaming really isn't that much of a hassle. Any hey, if it keeps the cellulite off...<br /><br />Disclaimer: Free for review.",5
"This Velma wig was a little less puffy at the bottom than I was hoping for.<br />The fake glasses were fine too, I didn't end up wearing them since I have Rx glasses that are close enough.<br />All in all wig and glasses set is nice. Just not cosplay quality, but for me for Halloween it was good.",5
"I love using silk scrunches, especially at bedtime.<br />Other scrunches seem to pull at my hair and cause breakage, but not these.<br />These scrunches are made of high quality mulberry silk.<br />I’ve used others that claim to be silk but are not.<br />These are the real deal.<br />They do a good job at wrapping in my hair, but they are silk, so they do slide down.",5
"These are fine cheap tattoos.<br />Which is all I needed them to be.<br />They applied well, no half tattoo left on the card like some.<br />No wrinkled applied tattoo like others.<br />But these did wash away quickly. They were gone within a couple of days.<br />Which, for a parent isn't a bad thing. I've had my kid put on a tattoo and it's lasted over a week.<br />The animals/cards are not all matching, and I was pretty surprised by some of the cards that look very cartoonish and some are more realistic looking.<br />There are 40 cards in total. I have included a picture of all the cards. And then a closer of four of the sets (jungle animals, marine animals, circus and insects). Hopefully that is helpful.",4
The clear clip had a gold tint to it - which I LOVE!<br />I have thick shoulder length hair and these clips hold my hair in really well!<br />The middle hair tie color is like a brown grey combo.,5
I have super thick hair and most coils don’t hold my hair well.<br />These hair ties do a great job keeping my hair in place without having to redo my pony constantly throughout the day.<br />My daughter has curly thick hair so these are great for her as well as the cover toes don’t get caught horribly in the curls!,5
This set works much better than the ones that come with the dip powder sets.<br />My only issue is that the brushes are not the best.<br />I have to be very careful when opening these bottles and taking the brush out.<br />It tends to spray the liquid and a paper towel covering my table isn’t enough. A towel is needed to protect my table finish.,4
"The package states that the beans were manufactured on 1/29/2021 and expire 1/28/2024. I did find that the was cracked at some times while using, which surprised me because the strip wasn't too thin at all with good edges and wasn't too cool. But the biggest surprise to me was that it was at the correct consistency at 158 vs 130 like the bag advertises.<br />The main ingredient of this product is pine resin and I could smell the pine in the beans as soon as they began melting.",3
"It's hard finding a waterproof brown mascara that is actually brown!<br />This mascara is a great brown.<br />It's not a black brown!<br />The mascara applies very easily and isn't too watery or too thick.<br />My only issue is that it doesn't have the staying power that I've come to expect from a waterproof mascara.<br />After a night's sleep, it's gone.",4
"This wig is just ok!<br />My daughter really dislikes the bangs, I’m going to have to cut them (hopefully evenly!).<br />My daughter does find the wig to be a little itchy.<br />I wish that the wig would have combs built in up front to help the wig stay put better.<br />I had quite a bit of hair loss from the wig while using.<br />My daughter thought the wig was super uncomfortable to wear because of the bangs.<br />She thought the colors were cute and fun to wear!<br />I found it extremely hard to keep the pink and purple separate.",3
"I have very pale skin.<br />In my attached photo you can see my hand (no product), my leg (product) and a white sheet.<br />As you can see, my legs look a ton darker.<br />When not set right next to my plain skin - my legs don’t look very dark at all. But they have a nice glow to them that they don’t have without the tanner.<br />The tanner for me lasted about 4 days.<br />I did have some areas that I accidentally got too much tanner on (tops of my toes). It was easy for me to exfoliate those areas and the tanner blended better.<br />My skin didn’t look orange.<br />There is no noticeable smell to the product, which I really like.<br />I didn’t have any issues with any fabric getting dyed while wearing.",5
These bottles are well packaged.<br />My dropper doesn’t screw on my bottle like I expected it to.<br />The bottles leak a little when tipped.<br />The sprayer works great and gives an even spray across the surface.<br />I added a silicone bottle boot to the bottom of my sprayers so that I could easily identify them and also it helps to prevent me from cracking it when I accidentally hit the edge of my counter with the bottle.,4
The cat eye look is so cool!<br />The glittery blue covers so well!<br />These polishes dry under a UV Lamp in under 90 seconds!<br />After using these nail polishes I feel like I have just went to a nail salon!<br />I’m very happy with this set of nail polishes!<br />The magnet they include does a good job at creating a cat eye!,5
This deodorant is thick as some other natural deodorants I’ve used are.<br />You need to warm it up under your pit for awhile before swiping.<br />This deodorant doesn’t have a scent and stays in the tube without making a mess.<br />My only issue with this deodorant is that if I’m sweating my pits do get wet while wearing this deodorant.<br />I don’t stink but I do need to be careful of pitting out.,4

"I got this for my daughter to dress up for school like George Washington. I figured I could make her hair grey. I started out with not much product in my hair and it went across the hair really good and left grey streaks as if she was naturally going grey. It looked really good. But I wanted all grey hair and so I kept going. Her hair is chin-length, so really not that long. This turned into a mess. It didn't look natural anymore and it was clumpy, etc. If you want a product to add some grey strands to your hair this is great. If you want to look 100% grey, this won't do it for you. I was surprised by the shininess of it when I opened it, but when it went on it really looked very natural.<br /><br />**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below.",3
This spray bottle gives a nice even mist when used.<br />My daughter has curly hair so I use this for her hair product.<br />The packaging shows that it would also work good for misting plants and de-wrinkling clothes.<br />The bottle holds 160ml (5.4oz).<br />When filling up the bottle make sure you don’t fill it over the line where the neck starts otherwise you are just waisting product.<br />It takes about 20 presses on the trigger to get the pressure built up for the sprayer.,5
A little bit of this nail polish goes a long ways!<br />It removes polish quickly from nails and in case anyone else spills their polish like me - it removes it from tile too!!<br />Good remover and made my nails shiny afterwards!,5
"I’ve used many different eye creams in the past. In choosing to take a chance on this one I was literally<br />shocked at what I witnessed upon applying this under my eyes. I wake with puffy eyes, semi wrinkles coming in at age 50. After cleansing my face I turn to this to work it’s magic. It only takes a very small amount to apply. I’ve never used the word shocked in a review but what I saw within a 2 minute period did just that. The area under my eyes instantly smoothed out & looked as if I had skin of a 20yo again. The longer I let it sit before applying my serum & moisturizer the more smoothing & softened the area became. This isn’t a harsh eye cream. I had no stinging, no bad reaction, it worked perfectly for my skin. There’s no scent to it. It comes nicely out of the dispenser. The smoothed & tightened area that I’ve clearly noticed remains this way even after the rest of my facial regime. I’ve never had anything like this before with truly how rapid it works on my skin upon applying. This morning I used it & moisturized my face only. What an amazing difference that again has lasted. Rapid Reduction it definitely is. A 1 ounce tube will last me awhile since a little goes a long way. Genuine quality with this cream & I highly recommend it. You’ll see the results!",5
I didn’t even open the package. Inside was filmy & appeared dirty with a clear substance. These are not made in America. The packaging was disgusting. I don’t recommend.,1
"Elizabeth Mott $et for Life Loose Setting Powder is the 1st type of powder that has kept my oily skin under control all day long. It’s a light powder that comes out of the container through little holes so I have control over how much powder I want in the top of the container where I pick up the powder with my makeup brush. The design is wonderful. It’s sheer & applies nicely with my discretion. It’s the last product I put on my face in the morning. I don’t wear foundation or any of that. After cleansing I use toner (not everyday) then my moisturizer with sunscreen & primer. Finally I’m complete this great face setting powder. I’ve never found anything that keeps my face in place before I found this. Hours later no oil can be seen on my face~and my skin is oily! Late afternoon I may use the face blotting tissues to set my face more, depending on where/what I’m doing. Even then little oil shows through. In the past I’ve used a matte powder which worked but not as good as this. My skin color would be considered beige in the matte powder so I was hesitant on this “Translucent” color but it blends in wonderfully. I don’t look too pale or too dark. I love it! This is my 2nd purchase & my 1st lasted a long time. So I’m set for life & I highly recommend it if you have oily skin.",5
The material is soft & perfectly held my hair in place. They’re comfortable to wear. I didn’t particularly care for the colors in person of these colors so despite the positives I returned them. I would recommend them though.,4
I was excited to include this steaming unit in my facial regime. After following directions the steam was very little to nothing at all. It may have been defective or simply didn’t do what was described or what I expected from it. The money paid was not worth it.,2

First and foremost these are not your ordinary everyday bath bombs.  These are some fancy smancy ones.  I was quite shocked to see the packaging for these when they arrived I was not expecting this.<br />These have a beautiful well crafted box that these come in and inside of the box you ill find your 6 bath bombs wrapped individually and set in some small crinkle packaging.<br />When getting a packaged set of anything I usually always have one that I really do not prefer but this set of bombs they all smell heavenly.  Love the aroma these put out while in the tub and love how the aroma lingers in my bedroom for a while afterwards.<br />Love how these just relax you while sitting in the tub after a long hard day.<br />I am in love with this set and would purchase again.<br />I received these bath bombs for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to the conclusion by using these bath bombs myself.,5
This mirror is a blessing to have.  It is a great addition to my makeup vanity.  I love the way it looks just to sit out for decoration.<br />Mirror is light weight yet the base is heavy.  The mirror does turn over to have normal side then to flip it is magnified.  The best part of this mirror is it is LED illuminated.  It took 3 AA batteries which were supplied.  The toggle switch is on the base and when illuminated it gives that cool glow.  I love plucking my eyebrows with this mirror.  Easy to see and with the added light it works well.  The light is very vibrant and puts off a very nice glow.  Lights are on both sides.<br />I would consider all materials high quality by the apperance and by the weight.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with this dual sided mirror.  It has been a great item added to my makeup collection.  Works well to sit on the vanity to give you an additional mirror for up close application and for the magnification.  I am not sure how I have lived my 32 years without a mirror like this to apply my makeup or pluck my eyebrows.<br /><br />I received this mirror for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

"This is a good set of contouring colors.  It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br />I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.",4
"This is such an amazing set of brushes.  These brushes come enclosed in a nice case that has an individual slot holder and a flap that protects the bristles.  The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..<br />I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.<br />This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.<br />Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.  Bristles are soft and provide great makeup application.  Great case for portability and for freeing up space on your makeup vanity.<br />I received this set of brushes for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using the brushes myself.",5
Great bands for hair.  The are easier on the hair than standard rubber bands.  However if you have super thick hair these may not work for you.

This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using myself.,4
Great temporary tattoos.  My daughter and her friend had a blast playing with these tattoos.  They were easy to apply. Just like every temporary tattoo and the designs are vibrant and well colored.  Seemed to stay on the skin well and I had no issues with the temporary tattoos at all.<br />I am satisfied with the tattoos.<br />I received a discount for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by inspecting the tattoos myself.,5
I am a makeup junkie and I can tell you the worst thing about wearing makeup is cleaning the brushes.  Usually when I clean my brushes I clean them all at one time creating a huge mess and taking up my whole counter area as they are laying out to dry.  This brush holder works like a charm and is very compact.  It is very easy to assemble just connect the legs and its good to go.  This hold 28 brushes so it works great for me.  As I can fill it in no time.  There are different slots for different brushes.  It holds the brushes well and in place and I think because of them being upside down makes them dry faster and help hold their shape.  Love this new tool and now I dont dread cleaning my brushes any longer.<br />I received this brush holder for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

"I am a huge fan of shea butter!  I use it in several receipes as I am always making lotions, or salves.  This brick of shea butter does not disappoint.  It has the nutty earthy aroma which is normal for shea butter.  This melted down evenly.  I was able to easily blend it with other ingredients very easily. I had no issues with this product at all  The best part is it came with a free bottle of lavender.  Well that just gave me the go ahead to make some whipped shea butter lotion.  I put the shea butter melted it down, with some coconut oil, and cocoa butter and then added about 30 drops of the lavender to make me some great lotion.  All ingredients are good for the skin and will heal all dry skin issues.<br /> I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  this is my honest and unbiased opinion.",5
"These are cute, colorful and work well. They don't pull my hair or get so tangled that I can't get them out - a constant concern with curly hair. They are fun - I even wear them at work.",5
"I figured I would try this out because it was so inexpensive.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It burned my lips horribly, and is not eligible for return.  Money down the drain.",1
Me gustó es lo que esperaba por el precio,5
"Very cool accessory. Wore on my wedding day, but will easily find other days to wear them!",5
"The bristles started breaking soon after purchase.  Don't waste your money.  I've had 3 of these and they all do the same.  I finally sprang for a professional version and although much more expensive, at least I don't have to throw it away so frequently.",1
Love the quality of this item. Great price. I was disappointed when my item arrived cause it was broken in the corner. I was not going through the hassle of sending it back. When you pay good money for stuff you would think they would check the product before shipping it out!,5
"Liner is runny. Be cautious applying. Make sure you let it dry and reapply. Otherwise, smudges and won’t hold entire lash. Very full lashes. I like that there are different styles.",3
"Does not come with slip solution or base and top coat. Definitely need a primer and nail dehydrator. Otherwise, it’s a good buy. Light is very small. Takes a couple times to set.",3
"They are lightweight, the wire teeth are small, and they don’t hurt my head. Best hair bands I’ve found",5
"Arrived ahead of time which was super cool! I was incredibly excited to try this product out after seeing the buzzfeed video with them using it.<br />When I first opened the package, I was a bit shocked at how big of a bottle it was but how it seemed like barely half was full. When attempting to squeeze is out it was very much like trying to get the last of a product out of a container just as you're about to run out of it. All air, very little inside.<br />I did a small test area just to see if there was any kind of crazy reaction and I didn't have any issues. Goes on, peels off, wash away any little flakes that don't peel with it. However, when I went back to do a full mask I noticed that even though I had totally sealed it up tight, within about 20 minutes a massive amount of the product had leaked into the lid. I cleaned it up so it didn't solidify and placed the bottle upside down, so the lid was facing up instead.<br />The full mask itself went on nice and easy, just like the test. When I peeled it off, I did notice my skin felt fresher but it didn't really pull anything out. I checked the peeled off mask itself and while it had plenty of little itty bitty hairs from my face, nothing really noticeable. I checked out problem areas in the mirror and they looked basically the same, maybe with some blackheads and things closer to the surface and drawn up so they could be removed. The effect was minimal though and pretty disappointing.<br />I'll finish it off since there isn't much left and there is no point in not using it, but I won't be buying any more after this.",2
I am absolutely obsessed with this makeup bag. It keeps everything organized and easy to find. It is sturdy and durable as well as easy to clean.,5
This was a good items was good for several months then stopped working and had to purchase a new one since stopped charging and would not work. For how expensive it is should last more than 3 months,3
Works fast and well,5
"I will definitely buy this product again. I’m learning how to do polygel nails, and saw this mood ring looking polish. I knew I had to have it. I wish the pot was bigger.",5
I needed the sprayers for some Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus because Avon did not provide them and it is a huge mess trying to apply the oil without them. These sprayers  fit the SSS bottles and they spray the oil in a fine mist. Perfect.,5
"It smells like lemons, very nice.",5
This is an excellent value.. A great deal for your money. I will be purchasing this one again for my daughter's.,5
I love this product. It is easy and fun to use. And I am a red head with very light eyebrows and this was perfect for my skin tone.,5
"Great spray bottles! Love the different style of sprayer and ability to lock the handle. Very sleek look and functional sprayer. Only has one spray setting, which is like a mist, but works well. These were used for sanitizing during and after an event and worked very well!<br />The bottles themselves are a little thin, but held up and have served their purpose well.",5
"I purchased these bottles to make hand sanitizing spray.  None of the spray tops spray, they shoot out like a stream and the majority of them stopped pumping at all and broke which caused them to leak.  The sturdiness of the bottle is great, the tops suck!!!  Won't be ordering these again.",2
"I'm surprised how much I like this eyeshadow, considering how cheap it was. It's got a smooth, creamy texture, and mega pigment that lasts all day!",5
"I'm surprised how much I like this eyeshadow, considering how cheap it was. It's got a smooth, creamy texture, and mega pigment that lasts all day!",5
"Mine leaked in its little box, which is sad. The product itself is great though! It has a very light and sweet smell. It makes my skin feel amazing in the morning. I changed my whole morning routine from this. No more morning cleansing, just rinse with water, use a bit of toner and then a good spf. Honestly this is by far the best sleeping pack I've tried and I have crazy sensitive combo skin. (oily T, super dry everything else) I honestly am excited to try other scents,  I'm just so sad mine leaked in the box. All of the packaging is super cute too!",5
"This is a well made shower cap with two layers of waterproof fabric. Unfortunately it is very small. If you have a lot of hair or a larger head, water will get in around your face, and your hair will get wet.",3
this is just perfect and I sands up over time better than the scrubbing buff pad.  I like it very much. Very glad I tried it. Not to rough just right!,5
"AFTER. Using the Scalp Treatment from Paul Mitchell for a 10-30 minute soak in the tub, I use these and I love my hair!  I even use the thicker from the same line.  With the loss of my hair ... FROM using WEN ... I'm starting to see my hair grow back.<br />Packaging was terrible ... only reason for the 4 stars!  Good thing they where in a sealed bag!  What a mess to clean but the pump is working even though the top is damaged.",4
Wonderful hairspray and I would recommend it but the company over packs it in a small box. I'm surprised they didn't bust.,4
"Used for Christmas Gifts, one for myself and one for hubby to use in his car.  Great item..",5
Not sure how I ever quilted without these!  No more safety pins or straight pins!!!,5
I bought these as a gift for my mother and to replace the picks that she had used for years.  They work well and are sturdy.,5
Sorry for the late review that's what happens when you get OLD. Ok the product is excellent including your description and fast delivery I will be ordering more. Thanks for the excellent service.,5
"I purchased these to use in my traveler's notebook. I make ink backgrounds, and these work marvelously.  These arrived quickly, were well packaged and also came inside a really thick drawstring bag. They also give you a little surprise...and who doesn't love surprises?!? 🙃<br />The same style of blenders touted to crafters are three or more times the cost...save your money and grab these instead. The ink rinses right out plus I am using less ink than I did with the traditional foam blenders.",5
Great replacement heads for Sonicare. Works perfect!,5
"Doesn't matter where you buy them, who you buy from, etc.  There is a 50% chance you get a good bottle of polish and a 50% chance you get a bad one.  I have 3 bottles from 3 different places, 3 different colors (blue white and black) and the blue one is good, the white one is meh, and the black one is completely useless.  The white and black have bent brushes, and the white polish is a bit dried out but not the worst, kind of reminds me of using white-out before they changed the formula and it got all watery and they changed to a sponge applicator from a brush.  The black one is awful - it's literally just clumps of dried out polish with some occasional damp spots.  The blue one is okay, the polish is alright, but I wouldn't recommend using the brushes that came with these but buying a separate skinny brush for line work or whatever it is you want to do.<br /><br />I should mention I have been using them to fix an enameled piece of jewelry as opposed to doing nails, as that's what the jeweler recommended (nobody local repairs enamel resin and buying enamel is very expensive and you end up with a ton leftover), so a jeweler I trust recommended nail polish with a good resin sealant and that's what I've been doing.  Initially I had used an X-Acto knife to cut painter's tape around the shapes of different colors and metal but switched to this pink-colored liquid latex paint I saw on a youtube video for nail designs and it's much easier.",3
good product,4
Not real jade . Super porous so every time i used it after cleaning it id break out .,1
Cheap but ok,3
Love this product,5
I like to use these with a cleanser on my face and they are very nice.  I feel like they are a little scrubby without being abrasive.  And this price is cheaper than Walmart.,5
Purchased this because my other epilator was not pulling out my thin hairs. This does a little better but I promise it is not the most comfortable thing to do to yourself. It helps if you pull your skin while epilating.,4
Don't like the smell.,4
Tried to get gas and this thing was too big to fit into the slot to get my card out. Literally had to try my hardest to get my card out. 🙄 idk if it was just that pump but if this happens again I will be returning!!,1
So cute,5
Well made & looks great for protecting make-up brushes.,5
WOW nice product.,5
"Really pretty box. However, it came with the top separators unassembled. These are vitually impossible to put together. I haven't decided if it's worth keeping. It's useless without these separators in place. Very disappointed. Tbese should have been glued in place.",1
"I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter...she fixed her own hair into a ballet bun for lessons, and this really finishes off her look!",5
Helped me out so much.,5
"Once I learn to use it, so I don't  look a clown, I'll  love this product. But it will take a bit of practice.<br />I do wish though, that it came  in a lighter colour.<br />It's a bit too dark for me, as I am turning gray.",5
"Arrived damaged. The package had been torn open and taped shut (see pictures). Also, the lavender variety is not filled as much as the other two (again see pictures). Either the lavender weighs less than the advertised 14oz, or the other two weigh more. Or, it was used and returned and then the remaining product was poured into a new bag and resealed. Pretty disappointed with this purchase. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom, it arrived on Christmas Eve so no time to return it (not complaining about arrival date; I knew it would arrive today). I will keep the lavender for myself since it obviously has less product than the other two.",2
Love all the colors and they are soft. Some were even given to a school to sues as sensory materials.,5
Beautiful colors. Great for table decorations.,5
Packaging (not amazons box) could be better.  Several were permanently bent (why I gave a four bc some were just too damaged).  But overall absolutely adorable.  I used as table decor for our tea party but we also put them in our hair.  We will definitely have many uses for these!,4
"If you are going to wear a mask, better to match with your outfit.  I always go in style, never look like a slob in public",5
"I see the dentist every six months, and get a excellent check up each time,  I guess it is working like a charm.",5
This is not a bad product but I find that I have to cure the nail longer than the polish recommends to get it to cure. I wish I had gotten a better one but I was going for low cost. It still works ok and I'm not super disapointed but time is an issue go with a better lamp,4
"Soft, durable and pretty colors",5
Great for my purpose of storing home made products,5
It is very sparkly. Really nice for the price,5
"First off, the pump didnt work therefore I had to open cap and try smacking it out. Next the black specks I had to get off my face before i could even put on my makeup. It reminded me of a cheap product. No, I wouldnt recommend product.",4
This is a wonderful product that I stumbled onto by accident.  I will never buy anything else.  Lasts all day.  Never smears or smudges.,5
"These were the lowest price I could find for the 3 2-oz, bottles. I needed them for a trip so had to have small bottles for the plane. Had to have them but the price per ounce is exorbitant!",4
I've been skin polishing now for 20 years. I lived in Japan from 97'-2000. I started doing it there when I went to the onsen. I had been buying skin polishing towels in Seattle. I was looking online to see if there was anything better. This towel is AMAZING. My skin was as smooth as a baby's ass after. If you're not used to skin polishing I recommend that you start with a regular towel. This is definitely a more intense experience.  For experienced skin polishers though AMAZING. I just ordered my 2nd one!,5
This eye cream was recommended to me by a beauty expert and she wasn’t wrong.  The search is over for a hydrating eye cream.  A very little goes a long way.  I already see and feel a difference and it’s only been a few weeks since I began using this cream.,5
"I absolutely wore my previous Earth Therapeutics sleep mask out - it was downright embarrassing to put it on if anyone was around. I was thankful to find this supplier with the 2-pack of the masks.  I am set now for quite a while. If you want a soft, cushiony sleep mask that doesn't let any light in - this is the answer.",5
Does the job,5
No French tip? French tip Valentines nails is what I wanted. Not what I received. I am waiting until Valentines Day to apply them. I will update after I’ve wore them a few days. Or I might return them. I’ll update either way.,1
"Yes, they fit the Sonicare and are the same size as the previously available compact brushes, but they do not have the same cleaning ability. They are too soft and the bristles really don't seem very effective. If you are like me and need a smaller toothbrush head, you are probably trying to replace the awesome compact heads Philips Soniscare used to offer, but these just don't cut it. I'll use these for now, until I can find a true replacement, but won't buy again.",2
"My cats have never liked any kind of brushing, but as they get older they're having a hard time grooming themselves and so I decided to try this. They both LOVE it! It gently pulls out loose hair without tugging on their skin and they just lay there and purr and purr while I brush them. It's also really easy to clean.",5
Wife likes,5
Not bad.... takes a minute or two to get your tone!,4
"Great brushes for the price! The handles are a little less comfortable than some brushes, so I won't reach for these every single day, but I usually use 3 or 4 eye brushes a look so I have been working these FARAH brushes in.",5
Purchased as a gift for a twenty something and she loves it. It is small enough to look nice (if you like stuff in your nose). It is &#34;dainty&#34; looking and has not caused her to break out or have any adverse reactions (which she has had before with cheaper jewelry). Good purchase.,5
This is a seriously wonderful invention...I'm amazed how much better my feet and legs feel.<br />I really like the soap that is included too!<br />The cord is well made and it easily hangs up in my shower.<br />The bristles are amazing.<br />I have had no problem with the Foot Brush Scrubber attaching to my shower floor with its small tiles - the suction cups work.,5
Works pretty good! No problems so far!,4
"I didn't use these for pig tails, but the color matched perfectly with my daughters hair.  I use it for her pageants, nice pretty curls, easy to clip on too!",5
I really like the smell of this.  Fresh clean scent!  Cute bag to just toss in my suitcase.,5
"Ordered this headband for July 4. Super cute and comfortable. Comes with 4 headbands in the package, so I was able to give one to my friend, too! Highly recommend if you're looking for a cute accessory for the 4th",5
Great products for my hair type,5
Son geniales. Súper absorbentes. Con solo dejarla.un rato el pelo queda húmedo sin necesidad de refrejar. El material muy suave. Son ideales.,5
"I haven't seen any real results. There is some ingredient in there and I think it is retinol or something that is causing the area around my eye to heat up. So, I know it is doing something. But I haven't seen any significant results!<br /><br />I will update if this changes!!",3
"I absolutely love this this. I am officially obsessed with baebody! Although, like I mentioned in other names not a huge fan of the name but the quality.. Woah. The quality is there. I like that this scrub is a little drier. Why? Because it's not gross and goopy and getting everywhere. When a scrub is drier it is more versatile for your hands, feet, and where ever. I tested this on my hands and omg did my hands feel amazingly soft afterward. It's late and I am too tired to try on my feet but I am now really looking forward to my next shower!<br /><br />I do think this will preform best a bit dry first then dampen. You could also soak your feet in warm water to soften the skin and more than likely get optimal results!!!<br /><br />Well worth it!!!",5
"It definitely has retinol in it. I use retinol products and I wanted something specific for my eyes to work on as I call them crinkles. Well the circular dots I use for right between my eyebrows and then the eye pads for obviously under the eye. They tinkle but not burn so you can feel it penetrating the skin. It comes with this weird little scooper I found absolutely useless.<br /><br />But, I really like the product. It sticks on easily!<br /><br />I got this product discounted for a fair and honest review. Totally worth buying!",5
I’ve been using this for years! It exfoliates my skin gently and feels super clean.,5
NOT waterproof or tear proof. Looses adhesion with just watery eyes. Does not last all day. But looks GREAT for a while,3
"Be sure to order 2, I read reviews so I knew what to expect.",5
Did not prevent fogging of my glasses and was uncomfortable. Made the bridge of my nose sweat terribly.,2
Fantastic product. I used it for the wet felting method and it worked perfectly.,5
Nice,5
Just alittle dry & waxy for me,4
"So far, these have been very nice files especially the buffers!",5
"Great Clips, really grabs and holds your hair.",5
"Really happy with this concentrate. I did not expect it to work well but am very thankful to be wrong. It thickens to the normal consistency of conditioners after it cools. It’s very moisturizing for my thick curly hair. My only issue was the scent. Very strong herbal scent. It was not really my thing but a little added essential oil was all it needed. However, in the future I’ll just order the unscented and add my own scent",4
You get what you pay for,1
Didn’t change color much and stained everything around me,1
I’ve had better I’ve had worse,3
Honestly I don’t use half of the stuff they give but it does work very well,3
After 14 years the straps had stretched out but the mask was still usable since the velcro on one side stuck to the straps themself. However after 14 years of handwashing the internal padding had gone flat.<br /><br />They come individually packaged in moderately heavy plastic. I slit one end of each package have used them to store and keep the masks clean when not in use.<br /><br />The new masks have no fragrance unlike the originals.,5
The pump  never worked right,1
Wife loves these,5
I had to shoot a video and the director suggested this... it works amazing.,4
"I used this preservative in my home made lotion recipes. I use it along with &#34;Leucidal Liquid SF&#34; together they make an extra powerful preservative system in my lotions and  creams. Linatural can be used alone as a preservative solution, I just like to use both. It keeps me free of any worries of contamination.",5
I've really enjoyed the results from this cleanser. It helps keep my oily skin matte without drying it out.,5
"Omg!!! This stuff is magic. I thought I was exfoliating properly,but when I used this the amount of skin that came off was crazy. It's also super gentle. I have extremely fair, and sensitive skin. This didn't irritate it at all.",5
"I am a die hard Coochy Cream user....I have always used Original scent, but this one is very pretty.",5
"It comes off faster than the cheaper eyebrow pencils, and this was supposed to be long-lasting. Very disappointed in this. More so because I bought more than these.",2
I will give update when over time,4
I would highly recommend this hairnet. I have a lot of hair and this is by far the best hairnet to contain it all under my helmet. I'll never use any other hairnet. They have held up well and are beyond easy to use. I have many of these hairnets and don't have any complaints.,5
Comfy and makes it hard to get out of the bath,5
It is perfect to cover straw gray eyebrow hair.  I last about 2 1/2 weeks.,5
"I will probably buy some more. I love that it is so soft, so stretchy and so comfortable. I am really glad I purchased them.",5
I like it and don't like it. I guess I just need practice.,4
Very easy to use.,5
easy to fill clean light for night time and has good mist! great price,5
This really works well in holding up compression stockings.  It should work equally well in other uses preventing those unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions.,5
This was my first purchase of nail art stamp templates and I was impressed with the selection and the price.  I have tested a few and love the designs.,5
As described. Fast shipping,5
GREAT FOR THICK NAILS,4
"What can I say? No mo sting either for my intensely pruritic post menopausal lichen sclerosis lady parts. Trying to avoid colorful language here. But maintaining proper pH for the cooter goes a long way toward preventing UTIs. And the wipes are good for post coital freshening up. You’re supposed to pee after sex to avoid retrograde bladder infections, ya know. Just don’t throw wipe down the toilet.<br /><br />But here’s more food for thought. We paid $600 to have soap scum removed from grout, tile and glass shower doors. The person said no more bar soap, leaves a residue, body wash only. So I moved to guest bathroom and use this stuff and liquid soaps only. No more supporting local goat’s  milk alkali soap artisans. My shower stall is pristine, husband’s shower is returning to its previous condition.",5
"This is a great set, a wide variety of colors, some glitter, some shattered. These are to be a gift for my nieces and they'll be thrilled.",4
"So I struggle with regular strip lashes,  but with these they are an absolute breeze to put on. I was worried the magnetic liner wouldn't be strong enough... IT IS!! It's actually a little difficult to get off your eyelid. I do want a coupe seconds before applying lashes so liner can slightly dry. I would definitely recommend this for beginners or anyone who struggles with strip lashes.  The only thing I would change is these are definitely more ""natural"", and I like a little more fullness.",5
Love this product. A little more expensive than in retail store but worth it in saving a trip to town.,5
"These face towels are the bomb!  They're big, absorbent and strong.  I've ordered dry towels before that felt slick and had a weird texture and smell, but these are cloth like and have no smell.  I use them to dry my hands before removing or inserting my contact lens, and for washing my face.",5
Very frizzy and hardly able to brush.,2
Love the styles and fit. Needed more headbands for work. Only dilemma is which one to wear first.,5
This product was recommended by a dermatologist so I used it and my face immediately started burning! I lost feeling in my face for 1 hour and my lips for 3! I do not recommend!,1
"I like that this toothbrush holder is a generous size, is sturdy, and the cost was reasonable.",5
The bobby pins look nice although one fell part after one use. They've bee very useful with COVID and not getting my haircut!,4
Absolutely love this!  Has helped remove those little bumps on the back of my arms and legs. I feel super clean every time I use it!  It is very long. Have thought about cutting it in half but I’m afraid it may unravel. I highly recommend!,5
Some of the brushes feel a little thin. I like a nice dense foundation brush. But very soft and blends nicely.,4
I’ve used many brands of nail strips with much success. NOT THESE. The adhesion didn’t last more than 2 hours. Other brands lasted me weeks. These unfortunately are going in the trash. Do not buy.,1
"blends into one color after a day's wear. Hard to complain, though, since the Huda Beauty palette that this is a dupe of  is 40 something bucks.",4
"I ordered this one, because the previous one I had ordered &#34;Utilize&#34; didn't last not even a year. Hubby told me that sometimes the charger goes bad. I never over charged it or mistreated it. So I ordered this one ...let me tell you, this one is powerful and it works great! Love it, does the job quickly, no complains from me and it cost less than the other one, can't be that. It brings a extra coarse replacement roller and a regular coarse roller...and a light!",5
This was a good Exfoliate if you have normal skin. I have to have a pretty heavy duty exfoliate so it wasn’t strong enough fir me,4
This is my favorite conditioner. Cannot find this out here in the country.,5
I like it is creamy and goes on my face so soothing.,5
"It was ok. Burned a bit when used. Hard to keep it out of your eyes when it's intended for use on your eyes. Somewhat expensive. Used, then replaced with a wipe type product. Eventually stopped the itching and irritation.",3
Love the colors and the fabric is perfect!!,5
"Ok, I read the directions, I read the blogs, I watched the YouTube videos and I still ended up using more polish remover than admiring my skills.between my 16 year old and I we managed to get on a couple stamps that semi resembled what they were supposed to! I highly recommend spending your money on a manicure instead. Although there is a great variety of images to choose from and they are really cool, I just don't have the months it would probably take to master this. The product itself I think is of high quality and any professional or highly skilled person would be impressed by the variety of images and quality of these plates.",4
Extensions,5
I love this little brush pad cleaner. It puts the fun in hygiene,5
"I had experienced really good results from pimple patches containing CICA (brings down swelling/soothing) which is why I decided to try out this lip balm. My lips are generally dry, but get even more chapped/cracked in the winter. I have been using this product for almost a week now and the cracks in my lips have almost completely healed and feel smoother than last week. I apply a generous layer before I go to bed and my lips remain moisturized until morning. It has no color/flavor/odor and does not feel sticky/oily when applied. Will very likely order again in the future.",5
This is great for dry skin. And it's super healthy for you! I only feel like I need to apply this once a day (depending on how often you wash your hands),5
"Easy to use, good teeth. Thank you.",5
HEART No where near as dark and bright as photo,1
I like it because it is smaller than the one I use at home so it's great for travel,4
"Perfect if you like a shimmery blush! I really like it for Summer as it easily gives a strobing effect. There was A LOT of packaging, but it came well protected and worked perfectly! It's also pretty enough to sit on display!",5
"I've gotten two products from this lines recently and I'm SO PLEASED! I have had no adverse reactions and have been seeing results in my forehead (deep lines) as well as next to my eyes and mouth (fine lines). I have a very expressive, default-smiling face and these just took a few years off my face in the span of a fortnight.<br /><br />One negative: the top spins to expose the pump, but pressing the pump spins the top. You have to hold it in place, which can be pretty awkward!",4
Not worth $.  I waited to long to return item.,1
"The stencil material is very thin and slippery. It also comes curled up so it’s difficult to flatten it enough to do an eyebrow. I tried and used the pounce tool and wasn’t impressed. No sharp lines, just blurry looking brows.",2
Good purchase.,4
"Absolutely LOVE this hair. To be honest, it is nothing like what you see in the picture but has its own beauty. Length falls just past shoulders and upper back (I cut my shorter). The color is stunning. The texture is SOFT with great movement. The wave pattern is flexible. I brush my out for a more natural look matching my own hair. Because it is synthetic, to get more curl back, I use a spray of water and fabric softener (Downy) and it returns to a wonderful curl pattern.<br /><br />Right out the beauty shop, I had compliments from strangers and friends! An EXCELLENT purchase.",5
"How I got along without this, I just don't know. It's a KEEPER. Give up the stick-held back scrubbers. This design is sooo much better. Looks like I will be buying more to toss into my holiday gift baskets.",5
"Bought one for me and one as a gift. Love the product. It's well made and does exactly what the description says it will do. Appreciate the choice of textures for buffing and for scrubbing, especially on hard to reach places like my back.  Would highly recommend.",5
Perfect match!!! But my hair is longer than this extension. Didn't know it until I put it on. But it does make my hair look fuller! Thank you so much! FAST SHIPPING TOO :-),5
great well made colorful and big enoufh for rollers,5
My favorite,5
My two older teenagers love this and commented on the fact it feels good on their scalps. They also both like the scent.,5
"I've been using this since I bought it in December 2020 and I still love it. It is such a space saver compared to my high wattage UV-only lamp, and I don't have to worry about busting those UV tube-like bulbs.  I really like how this LED lamp doesn't heat up and fry my skin and works faster than the UV.<br /><br />Just wish I could figure out how to get the count-UP timer to work again when I put my hand in without pushing a timer button.",5
Wish it was longer,4
Can't wait to start using.<br />Just as listed.,5
I really like the products from this company. I have been using them for over 3 years and satisfied. I find them reasonably priced and my skin never feels like I am being smothered. Really comfortable to have on and I'm in south FL.,5
Love the smell! Introduced my daughter to it as well and now I have to share my order with her!,5
Perfect for me,5
We saw this one advertised on our German TV channels and my daughter tried this out during track season and she said it works great.,5
"It didn’t take long at all for me to notice a difference in my hair growth. It works wonderfully. It’s very easy to use, just a quick spray, and the scent is pleasant. Most importantly, it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Very happy with this!",5
"It's rounded so it has to fit the shape of your nail. My nails don't fit it and so it cuts the nail in new moon-shaped pieces. Otherwise, it's sharp and looks like a solid product, well-made. Not returning due to the hassle....",4
My son loves this product,5
"Beautiful, thick and well made! Love it!",5
No dislikes really like the color it’s good lipstick for the price and it stays on,4
Flower was cute. I’m a rockabilly woman so I like the flowers and that’s a pretty flower,5
Really pretty colors I love the design of the flowers I thought they would be bigger but actually they’re actually a good size so I ordered another package perfect awesome,5
Too stretchy to get any meaningful scrubbing going on. I have to fold it in half to get it to work the way I want.,3
So far I am happy with the application of this cream to my sore thumb joint and wrist pain. It certainly does ease my pain overall. I apply liberally 2 times daily to affected areas. I am in the early stages of the DMSO applications. My neighbor has bragged about this cream for months. I will keep y'all updated.,4
This dosen't work,1
I love this product. It does not take 1-2 minutes thos not even. I applied 3 times to get to the point I wanted and to cover all spots. Once you have a lot of hair it takes longer. I still dont know how long it lasts but I like the results so far.,4
The combination of a great brush and non clumping mascara really is appreciated.  Need makeup remover to get it all off but one of the best I've used.,5
Perfect for removing makeup & great value,5
Smells nice.  But it is super watered down.  Stick to the name brands,1
GRAINY AND NOT SOFT.  DOES NOT SPREAD NICELY,2
My mother swears by this stuff! She is 70 and suffers with arthritis badly in her arms and legs.  She says she doesn't want to take pain meds all the time and she says this oil really helps take the edge off her arthritis pain.  So I ordered her 2 more bottles :),5
Works good,5
"I'm ordering more!  Really high quality, densely packed brushes with no fallout and seamless blending.  💗",5
Good hair push. I use it daily on my wigs.,5
Ineffective,1
"I've recently discovered this type of make-up sponge and they are such an improvement over the old-fashioned wedge sponges. This is a great set of four that come is a plastic bag with a zipper closure to store those you aren't using. I've found the make-up sponges to be soft, easy to use, and easy to clean. I have found them really useful in applying and blending liquid primer and concealer. I'm very pleased with this product.",5
"This is a fun palette with a variety of pretty, trendy colors. Some colors are matte and some are sparkly. Some of the colors are a little brighter than I would normally wear. However, I really like the way the more subtle colors look on my eyes. They look especially nice when I also use a bronzer on my cheeks. The shadow goes on smoothly and continues to look good throughout the day. I also like the packaging which isn't fancy, but still has a well-made magnetic closure.",4
"I love this polish! I am familiar with this brand but have never tried it before now. I am impressed with how smoothly the nail polish goes on, even for someone like me who isn't that skilled in applying polish! It dries fairly quickly, and then wears well without chipping or peeling.<br /><br />The color is described as &#34;coral glistening with copper shimmer&#34; but I would actually just call it a copper shimmer. It's attractive and bright enough to be noticeable, but neutral enough to go with whatever color I'm wearing. I'm very happy with this polish and will be looking for other colors by essie.",5
"I am a returned user. Had tried and reviewed this product a few years ago. It does what it says it will do. What I don't particularly care for is, with usage, my hair has to be washed every other day or it ends up looking greasy, limp and stringy. Also, the smell is definitely a medicinal odor with the Taila. But the results outweigh my complaints: Considerably less flaking of my very dry scalp, less shedding (yeah, I lose hair like a Husky), receding hairline seems less so, and sometimes I have to actually search for my small truly bald spot at the back of my crown rather than it displaying itself at every opportunity. A pleasant surprise this second time around is that some of the new growth is coming in my natural black rather than silver or white as it had been. This was totally unexpected at my age, although I did read it might stem greying. Makes it look like I have more hair at my hairline with the darker strands growing in. So ignore my complaints. I decided to. It works.",4
"I would have given it more stars except for the dropper/bottle. The serum itself, at least the bottle I received, was too thick for the dropper to be of any use. In fact, turning the bottle upside down even did not speed the serum up in exiting the bottle. I had to insistently tap the upturned bottle on my palm to get any serum out. However, the serum itself works very nicely for my skin. I will not be purchasing it again, though. It was too much hard work to access the serum and some serum even remained stuck within the dropper after finishing the bottle, so it felt like I did not get my money's worth, despite the reasonable product cost.",3
"I've used this hairspray for years and it is the best. So when I started using the spray in this order I immediately noticed it wasn't right. The can looks almost identical to the others I use. However, the ingredients aren't even close to the same. I feel like it is false advertising and very misleading. And especially frustrating because I purchased six cans.....that can't be returned. Don't buy this or use this seller.",1
I thought the polish would come out like the metallic finish of the bottle but it does not. It’s more of a sparkly gray. I don’t recommend this product if you’re looking for a real mirror finish.,2
Worked for about 10 used and then the water reservoir cracked and leaked. Unusable now.,2
Always top quality,5
"#3 silver is supposed to be DARK BROWN and silver. It is reddish brown and silver. Not even close to the pictures on 2 different screens. Definitely in the red family.<br /><br />Update: just put them in, sorta hard by myself but I've a broken ankle which doesnt help; the hair is consistently thick from top to bottom. That matters. If it were thinner on the ends, it'd have actually blended better with MY long hair. That said, I should've gotten 20&#34; as I underestimated my hair length. So I ended up trimming 2&#34; off of the thinner ends of MY hair and it has that kinda 'choppy' look. I like it! So far so good. I did use a hair dryer to warm up the adhesive and pinch tightly afterwords. Hope it'll last! But I'll get the black and silver next time.<br /><br />Another Update: this hair is NOT STRAIGHT hair. It is permanently tightly wavy. Need a straightener to make it straight. Lost another star, now a 3*. Should be 2* because it has failed its description.",3
"Bought to wear for Packer football! Just as described and looks great! Go green and gold! Go pack! By the way, it is EXACTLY as described and displayed. Don't dock stars because you buy it long then don't like it long! Sheeze!",5
"Been using these now for over 6 years, no change in quality at all, just price. As with everything with this lousy economy and high inflation, this is to be expected..... Unfortunately. But the product rocks. Head to toe exfoliation with every shower!",5
"Garbage, don't waste your money. They look like catapileras on your eye lids . Liner is poor qquality. Just bad.",1
this perfume smells sweet and delightful. I love it. Makes me feel at peace and happy.,5
I believe this product has helped with my neck but I don't think I can justify the cost. Looking for a less expensive alternative.,4
Didn’t do what it said!  I had very high hopes for this pencil but it didn’t deliver:(,1
"Wish I could give them negative stars!  Tin foil is stronger!<br />Horrible, flimsy, flakes, and NOT true to color.<br />I could spend half of their cost at Walmart and get 10x better nails!<br />These are just horrible!",1
Found I was severely allergic to Hairprint products. I tried the color restorer and 2 different shampoos and had a bad reaction with itching all over. I had to throw out the products.,1
This is very easy to use and really does a great job whitening your teeth!,5
Very disappointed.<br />Cheaply made. The joins of the fabric are by the fabric that goes around your ear so all day you feel a knot of fabric. We washed them before having our employees wear them and the joins are coming apart!  If it wasn’t for those they would have been great masks. Very disappointed. Waste of our money,2
"The product is good, but tube is only half full. I feel cheated when the container is much bigger than the contents.",4
Great value for your money and it works well.,5
Love the product,5
Finally a company that delivers the product they display. Soap lovers know what I mean. This is actually the international version as displayed! Fresh and if you like carving soap they are perfect!,5
Bought to make body butter and it’s perfect. You could just use it as is but I mixed it with Shea and jojoba oil. Came out a little greasy but works beautifully. Will purchase again when I run out of my current supply,5
This stuff smells amazing!! Works well to derange but might be a little too much for thin hair. Love it though,5
Great product and it does work,5
What I like about it is does my hair gradually and it works beautifully.,5
Now this was a pleasant surprise. It has that bohemian vibe and is just funky enough to be cool. I super like it!,5
This seller is low grade. My product arrived with the conditioner coming out the top of the lid. Masking tape was being used to hold the lid in place. Not professional at all,2
This work better than anything I've tried,5
"Was hefty, well-built and quality product as hoped for, at great price.  Recommended!",5
"Worth the price and distance to buy these. They are the only deodorants that will work 24h for me. Never found any other like these. Wish they were less expensive but cannot find them in the USA, only France.",5
"This is a great set and works great. Comes with everything we needed, multiple attachments and the small unit works well for travel. The small does not have any adjustments, but a good size and decent functionality for travel.",5
This make-up was difficult to apply - removing it from the container to the sponge was not easy.  I used this make-up in the 80s and I loved it.  The formula in this compact is not the same.,2
Love them,4
This brush would not hold up after a half dozen uses and being gently washed with warm soapy water and dried properly. It fell apart and the bristles came loose and fell out of the handle.,1
This is a good little gift package for the person who you care about that has a little bit of an odor issue,5
"It's creamy, price is fair,all natural ingredients. Even my man will let me put it on his rough .hands. I liked getting 3 bottles..one for bedroom,one for bath,and one for my daughter. Sweet!",5
My daughters use these and love them.,5
"Average. It did remove some blackheads, but other, more stubborn ones were left in the skin. It can be painful to remove as well. My skin was left pretty dry and flaky after using it.",3
After freezing this I could not get the unit apart and end up cracking wouldn’t waste your money on it,1
I love these! I like to scratch my skin with these as I am always very itchy. Awesome ! I replaced mine after a month because I like the rough of a new one. Probably could use longer before replacing it.,5
It looks great. But I never tried it yet! I have been carrying around in my purse for months! I’m not sure why I ordered it on line when I could have bought it at walmart🙂,5
I love this. Works so much better than a toothbrush. Plus it’s so much easier to clean when finished.Does a great job,5
Was a gift. My friend seems to like it. Said it holds the Bobby and hair pins well. True to size,4
I like this one since it looks very Renaissance.,5
I use this itm every day. It is a well made comb.j,5
Great product,5
"This shaver was a Christmas present for my Husband and he loves it. I read through reviews for about every brand before selecting this one and it was worth the time. He says it's the best shaver he's ever owned. For the price, I don't think you'll find a better shaver.",5
"Excellente producto,  buen material y color, entrega rapida antes de lo mencionado. Facil de aplicar.",5
"I was initially amazed how well this worked on the first application to my left eye.  right eye, not so much.<br />It is going to take practice to get them even.",3
"Really works on wigs needed to flatten it, light weight, quick heating.",5
Easy to use,5
This is a nice file for rough spots on your hands. It works best when you have just had a bath or shower.,4
"Nice smell, great quality, I struggle with finding a deodorant that works long and this one also stopped working for me after awhile, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work for you.",5
Awesome it comes with so many. But the product itself is not very good.,2
Perfect for hairstylists.,5
"Great price, works awesome helping to define already curly hair. Glove not needed but nice that it's included.",5
The quality of the product was good but i have fine and thin hair and this was just too heavy for me to use.,3
The best hair spray for my short hair<br />Glad I was able to find more on Amazon<br />Manufacturer doesn't carry it on their website,5
👍,5
Color ok but this is NOT long lasting!,1
"I have been through several styler dryers in my lifetime. They have been used on my hair since I was a kid. I purchased a Laila Ali dryer about 2 years ago and while it's pretty, it didn't last long. I had to replace it with this dryer. in comparison to the Laila Ali dryer, this one is more quiet, the combs are more secure and are smoother (doesn't scratch my scalp), and it doesn't get overly hot. I like the ceramic technology as well. It makes my hair soft and less static-y/ poofy. It takes a little longer to dry, but my hair feels much softer when  I'm done.",5
I have old acne scars and older skin.  This primer smooths out the lines and pores to make my skin look smoother!,5
Nice,4
Tingles as it works!  Help with hooded eyes.,5
"I love this item. I always clean my brushes now, due to this being so easy to use. I used to put off cleaning my make up brushes, and that is not good for your skin. I would recommend this to others.",5
This is a great tubing mascara. It stays on well and doesn’t leave any smudges.,5
"Since quarantine hit, I've been ordering nails from various stores so that I can still enjoy having my nails done while the shops are closed since I was an every other week nail girl before. These were great for about a week, and I loved how subtle the marble design was. Color was super pretty and matched everything I wore that week nicely. Would definitely recommend these.",5
Would be more useful if larger,4
"Me and my boyfriend both use this product for knee, back, and shoulder pain. It’s hard to find at our Wal Mart. I am glad to find it on Amazon and still at a good price. We won’t use anything else.",5
Did not receive all items. Let the company know and they promptly sent out replacement item. Excellent customer service! Will buy from them again! Product was exactly as described.,5
I’m surprised how great these are. They are the perfect messy bun and perfectly easy.,5
Used as a base for e-cigarettes.,5
Love this brand. I bought 2 and they're consistent.,5
Love this brand. I bought 2 and they're consistent.,5
Fun product to use. I don’t think it will get deep blackheads out. I did have some pull out. It has good suction. Definitely need to move around to prevent bruising.,3
These are pretty cool things. I have 2 away as gifts and kept one fro myself. While I have a small wrist it still fits on my hand without falling off. I use it when I go to the doctor or store. Easy to squeeze hand sanitizer into my palm whenever needed. It also holds a good amount so I can use a few times while out and about.,5
Love this organizer it keeps all my make up separated and easy to find highly recommend,5
I love this product.  The brush is great for massaging scalp while shampooing!,5
I am very pleased with the quality. It's very sturdy and was easy to put together. I like being able to customize the shelves to fit just about any shape or size. It is perfect for neatly organizing all of my things.,5
It was okay,5
"Love this product, will definitely buy again",5
"I tried 1 of the 3 on the first day i got them....Feb 7th. I put them on, covered them with socks and waited 90 minutes. Its now Feb 18th and my feet haven't peeled at all....my feet are just dry. I even tried using a 2nd one from the 3 pack a few days ago....no peeling at all.<br />I have used foot peel masks before from a local retailer that had my feet peeling in 3 days after use.<br />I do not recommend this 3 pack of foot peel masks. They are garbage and dont work as advertised.",1
"I wish its a bigger bottle, but thats alright! The color and sparkle is perfect. Simple and not loud! Love it!!",5
"This serum shrinks eye bags and it disappears like the commercial. However, afterwards you'll see dark circles instead of eye bags. If you try to cover it with concealer the serum released the tightness and whola you have eye bags again! Useless and a waste of money! DO NOT PURCHASE!",1
Poor quality! Unfortunately this did not last long at all! Completely non-operable in spite of new batteries replacement. Warranty is only good for two weeks. Beware!,1
"I have nerve pain as well as aches and pains in general which is rough. I was using something else which wasn’t bad at all. But when I used this Hemp Emu cream, it wasn’t until a few minutes later that I didn’t feel any more pain. It was 10 times more minimized compared to the other brand I was using. And, it also was not only stronger, but it last a lot longer! I would recommend this to anyone who has pain. I think I’ll thank the company whoever made it!~",5
Love love love this brush! It is so much easier than a normal straightener.  I wish I had bought one years ago.,5
"They are very attractive clips.  These clips would be nice when dressing up, but can be worn anytime. They seem like thick, good quality clips with a strong grip claw. I will say I am a little concerned about the stones falling out, but hope it will be Ok. I have thick, long, curly hair, so the clips won’t hold all my hair. I am sure they will be fine for most though. I can make them work, depending on how I use them. They are good colors for matching outfits in black or cream. I do wish they were a little bigger, but otherwise they are great hair accessories. Give them a try.",4
its the 1st time I bought brushes or used them.  There nice brushes.,5
Very powerful and versatile shaver. See below:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Ergonomically-shaped housing.<br />- Low battery warning light is very useful.<br />- Charges quickly. Pilot light indicates when fully charge.<br />- Cutting head can be raised or lowered to suit closeness of shave.<br />- Interchangeable shave head for close work.<br />- Whisker catch compartment is easily cleaned with enclosed brush.<br />- Vacuum system draws in cuttings to minimize clean-up.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />None:,4
"Wore for my wedding, and I’ve worked the headband into some bland outfits for work... tons of compliments!",5
"I am on the fourth bottle I think.  My lips have fallen in love with this stuff.  So moist, so soft are thy lips.  I think I'm going to put some on right now.  Buy it!",5
"Great little, and not so little bags for traveling. It's easy to see what's in them and they have been durable.",5
"First time in 20 years I've transitioned from a liquid concealer to a powder, the coverage is obviously not the same but this is by far the best performing powder I've ever had. I'm lucky in that my face at it's not-the-most-tan tiny works well with the light color but I can see how the limited color choices can be a deal breaker for some. It's smooth and not cakey, it blends well, feels weightless, and stands up to sweating and long work days with great shine prevention and it doesn't come off easily (a little when you blow your nose etc). I do not like the porcelain doll look and this works well for me for evening out tones.  I am 35 and have very sensitive skin, several minor facial scars, and occasional adult acne and this doesn't have any negative effects on my skin at all. It washes off easily with gentle face wash. It allows for a few spot touches of stick concealer, blends well, and holds well. Mine arrived with no breaks/cracks and the sponge works well. I really like the protective inner plastic case between the powder and the lid and sponge. Will buy again! I previously used Revlon, Covergirl, Neutrogena, and JUNGSAEMMOOL Essential Star-cealer Foundation which I was happy with the first time and then the following two were slimy and just not working well. For reference my current face tone is a revlon 300-310, a covergirl 705-710, and Starcealer Light. After peak summer I'm a more 310-320, 710-715, and Starcealer Medium (almost, its still a little dark for me).",4
"Was never the biggest fan of the scent, but as someone with ultra-fine always limp hair I greatly appreciate the increase in volume. There is no mousse or any other magical product that will change my thin thin hair or give me the volume most other people have, but this definitely gives a palpable thickening. These bottles are durable too, They spent two weeks tumbling from 5 feet up and smashing into the floor of my tub everytime my new and failed and now retired suction shelf/bin fell, but they never cracked or leaked despite so many falls.",5
"I bought this oil after using their avocado oil. Life-Flo is a great brand. I've never had issues with any of their products. This oil is food grade, cold pressed. It is a lighter weight than their avocado oil, but it works just as well. I use this on my son who is two to help his skin retain moisture (he has severe eczema). I put a cap full in his bath and apply it all over after his bath while he is still damp. His skin is soft and his eczema spots are softer, not as rough, but I still have to apply a layer of Vaseline to his rough patches to keep him from scratching and to keep his spots super moisturized. I use it on his scalp also once a week. I massage it through his hair and let it soak in while he's playing in the tub and I follow it put by shampooing his hair like normal. It absorbs quickly, and I do apply it throughout the day when I change his diaper. It doesn't have a scent to it really, which is a plus since I have to be careful with perfumes with him. It does make your tub slippery if you add it to your bath water, I always clean the tub after his bath to be on the safe side. We usually go through a 12 oz bottle every six months so it lasts a while compared to a gel baby oil (we go through one of them a month if we use it).  A little bit goes a long way. This oil used in conjunction with Vaseline and his prescription meds helps keeps his eczema in check, and I have discovered that we are using his prescription med less since we swapped over to this oil. For us this oil is more effective than coconut, avocado, baby oil, ceteaphil, or aveeno.  If it's for eczema we have tried it. He's had eczema since he was 3 months old and I feel like we finally found a product that I know is safe to use, it's all natural, no chemicals, and it's within budget.",5
"One of the straps broke off when I first used it. Nowadays, I just use it to scratch my back and apply lotion on my back.",1
I love how his product smells and the exfoliating was great. Highly recommended!,5
The other items in this line I liked a lot. This was unpleasant feeling and snaked more like first than coffee.,1
"The sizes were a bit difficult to figure out, but it was cute and easy to use. need your own glue, does not include glue as some sets do.",5
My daughters love these bright and bold colors. Cheerful and they get a ton of compliments on them when they wear.,5
These scrunchies have adorable prints. I love them and so does my daughter.,5
"These claw clips worked okay with my thick hair, but not great. The hair ties were too small.",3
"I was interested to try something new, but these did not work as well as the style I’d used previously. They are definitely more durable, but since I end up skipping them altogether, it’s not a saver for us.",3
"The buttons are not sturdily sewed right the headband. I have others with large buttons that support my large banded masks, these did not. The button flopped forward and the mask slipped off. It worked much better with the thin banded masks.",4
"This diffuser works well, my room smelled great. The kids enjoyed the soft color scheme as the diffuser was on. The ceramic looks very nice and it blends well with the decor when not in use.",5
"Well made clips are cute. If hair is fine, they may slide out, as they are surprisingly heavy for their size.<br />Good price and fun to use.",4
I absolutely love this stuff.,5
Very strong clips at a great price,5
Very easy to use .very comfortable.,5
"I purchased this product after severely cutting my heel with one of those blades used to cut the calluses from your feet. My husband had warned me of the dangers of using blades, and I've cut my feet several times. I read many reviews on this product and others before purchasing. It came in 2 days and had a charge when it arrived.  I keep it plugged in so it's ready whenever my husband or I are needing to use it. I'm very pleased with this product, and very happy that I purchased this.  It works very well and does a great job, and I use it at least once a week to keep my feet really soft. My husband also uses it about once a week also, to keep his feet smooth.  He was shot in the foot and the bullet fragments are still in his foot, and he gets calluses where the fragments are in his foot. I also purchased the extra rollers, but haven't had to change the original one out yet.  Those who complained about this product must not have used it properly.  When using don't press down thinking that extra pressure will help, it's not designed to be used like that.  Just lightly touch the area you want to treat and the file will definitely work well. For those who have a lot of hard calluses, you might want to either soak your feet first to soften the skin,  or use it everyday for a couple of days until you get the best results.  You don't want to over do it because you may cause your feet to be sore. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this wonderful gadget to anyone.  It will definitely save you a lot of money on getting pedicures elsewhere!",5
This is my 4th or 5th time reordering.,5
"The products are thick and difficult to use neatly, there are no instructions on how to apply or use the clip and it's so time consuming to complete",2
"This is my very favorite razor! And, at 72 years old, I have tried quite a few brands!  No nicks, just silky legs.  So glad they are still available!!😊",5
"I've spent time and money looking for a truly great razor.  This one has two complete sets of blades on the shaving head.  Now, beat that!  This has the smoothest glide, and gives the fewest nicks.  I am able to find refill blades locally, but not the razor.  So glad amazon can get them!",5
I REALLY LIKE THESE WILL ORDER MORE.,5
I love goat's milk soap because it is kind to one's skin.  Washing hands is great with this very fragrant peppermint.<br />Love it will be back for more.,5
"I do like the length my eyelashes can get with this product. I dont like the clumpy,spidery leg look I get when I apply it",3
I liked it so much this is my second one. It detangles well with my long hair and does not pull or damage the hair.,5
"I think anyone who follows me or knows me understands my needs for bags. I love them all. Big small, cosmetic, totes, ect. I seem always need one for something but this one is for my makeup for a change.<br />I have used my others for projects or other crafting items so I needed this. (no really I did (wink)) I think it's darling in looks. The pink color and black polka dots are a great combination. I think these would make a fabulous gift too!<br /><br />The bag is very well crafted in that there are no holes or ripped seams. All the pockets are sewn well into place and they hold my little set of brushes like a dream. I love the little mirror that is secured to the inside too.<br />The bottom is also well made and the zippers all glide with ease. The price of this little bag is more than worth it. It fits great under my counter and holds my daily cosmetics perfectly! I am super happy!<br /><br />Overall, great price, well crafted, holds my daily brush and make up, and it fits under my counter.<br />I have nothing negative to add at this time.",5
"I love bags, totes, storage bags, make up bags, ect.. I am always in need of them and when I saw this one I HAD to have it. It arrived in perfect condition, I see no holes in the mesh, no rips in the seams of the pockets or the bag it's self, the material is very durable, the zippers glide easy on each of the zippered pockets, the hanger is secured to the bag, and it holds all of my supplies and more.<br /><br />I am using this to store my cosmetics and every day face wash, moisturizer, make up brushes, foundation, and deodorant. I still have room for other items but these are the basics. It's so handy to stash under my counter, all I have to do when I am getting ready to go out is hang it on my towel rack to access all the things I use the most. This saves me lots of time searching through my drawers or other bags. I love the fact it has so many easy to access compartments because of the way it's designed it sits on my counter too! Bonus for hanging or counter use! I really like dual uses so I can use this for art supplies and other crafting things. I highly recommend everyone get one for the person who needs a storage bag!<br /><br />Overall, well made, no rips, no tears, secure closures, love the square design for counters or hanging, easy access compartments, great design, and stores under my counter.<br />I have nothing negative to add at this time. It really is one of the best little storage bags!<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not paid for this review, this is exactly the way I feel about this item after using it.",5
"What can I say, this product is just fine.  Yes, I would order this again.",5
"Absolutely perfect size of deodorant containers for traveling or samples. Doesn't allow melting of the deodorant under normal conditions (I've never left it on the dash), and the recipe did not leak out of the bottom. I was able to turn the round knob until the cup (there's a ""shelf"" inside with slightly raised edges that cups your produce to push it up) was half way up or so, and get a clean pour that did not even leak under the cup, as near as I can tell.",5
I had high hopes for this but to me it’s a little bit of a waste of money.  it seemed to work better for Other people. Not sure how many of these products they’ve tried but I know there are better out there because I had a better one it’s just a little more expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.  . The other product i used  thickened  and lengthen my lashes very quickly And quite thicker. A lot faster than this. This actually makes the rim of my eyes burn a teeny bit or tingle and then the itch. I would not recommend this product to anyone I know just because of how it is less than exciting.,3
They are pretty  Don’t love the  bristles but it is probably just The character of that particular kind of hair.  I got them very timely and they were packaged very nicely,3
"Works great, really pulls out the impurities. Be aware that if you have some low level black heads, this will pull them up and give you a pimple the next day. The best way to avoid that is to use it twice a week ;)",5
Can not say enough good things about Eminence products. I gave this set as a gift and she has fallen in love with them now as well.,5

"I love the scent. Not too strong, not offensive in a crowd. I just wish that it was a thicker formula. This lotion is really runny, and I don't find it very moisturizing. I find that I need to reapply with every single hand washing.",4
"Good, rich, unscented body lotion at the price",5
"Light, good coverage without being “masky.” Stays fresh, but washes off easily.",5

"This is a great concept, and it works exactly as it should.  That being said, be aware that your hair WILL catch and tangle into the beads that make up the pretty end, especially if you have long fine hair like mine.  You will say words that your mother should not hear you say as you tear pieces of hair from your head in an attempt to remove this.  I want to love it... It looked really pretty in my hair, but I will not be using it again.",3
"This PENEBELLA Anti-Aging Face Cream is filled with emollient oils, and not much green tea, which is something I love in a skin care product. My skin is normal to oily, but also sensitive, and cannot handle all of the oils in this product. It sort of just sits on top of my skin.<br />I really wish the company would have listed the ingredients, instead of pointing out the great ingredients that are in minute amounts. Aside from glycerin, the other touted ingredients are almost halfway down, or lower, on the ingredients list, or are not so skin friendly. Green tea is wonderful for your skin, but it is near the bottom of the ingredients list. Also, the type of vitamin C, Ascorbyl Palmitate, is not very skin friendly, and can actually be very irritating to sensitive skin, like mine.<br />This moisturizer may work well for those with very dry skin, but I would have liked to see the boasted about skin loving ingredients closer to the top of the ingredients list. Full transparency is always best, and will make customers happy. Listing some wonderful ingredients that are minimally effective in very small amounts, is a bit misleading. This moisturizer has way too many oils for my skin, is a bit irritating, and is not my favorite...",3
"This Hair Removal Device by Ulike just as well as a couple of other IPL devices I have that cost much less. It comes packaged nicely, though I kept trying to open the flat two-sided green piece that covers the accessory side. It doesn't open.<br />The device does look quite fancy, and I was interested in skin rejuvenation, which is in one of the photos (that is mentioned in the other listing that shows this exact same device). The instruction booklet contains about as much as the empty listing page that I ordered it from. That page has no bullet points, only one photo.<br />They do have another listing for this same exact device, showing the accessories, extra photos with bits of information, and bullet points telling a little about it. I got my information from there.<br />The device does have the cooling feature, as many others do, which helps it not to zap too badly. It also comes with a razor and eye protection.<br />What it lacks, that many others include that are in or around this price range, is more attachments for the device. There needs to be at least one smaller light head for use around the lip area, as it's very hard to use the main one with the device being so large.<br />This IPL device works pretty much as well as any other, with none having the ability to make you completely hair-free at any point in the future. As far as the studies that I have seen, with diligent use, home IPL devices can only offer a little better than 50-60%-ish less hair.<br />My preferred device, which costs very little more than this one, has several attachments, including some specifically for skin rejuvenation. You do get a fancy box with this device, and it looks nice, but I don't think it provides any more or less than devices that cost much less.<br />I haven't found one yet that really only takes 10 minutes to do your legs, but if I ever do, that is the one that would probably take the cake! If you like fancy boxes and a sleek-looking device, I would recommend this one.",4
"This LUXAZA 6 PCS Khaki Brown Neutral Eyeshadow Stick Set is so gorgeous! All of the colors are beautiful when applied alone, or used together. They are so easy to use and blend with the brush that is on the opposite end of each stick.<br />The colors are buildable, so you can have a whisper of color or make a bold statement. They also have great staying power, but can be washed away quickly with any cleanser.<br />My eyelids are naturally oily, so I have to add a wisp of translucent powder over top, so they won't stay tacky. They still keep the shimmer, too, which is not overdone. It is just right for my 51 year young self to wear and not look silly, just elegant.<br />I love this eyeshadow stick set! From the colors to the ease of use, it just works well. The colors would look beautiful on anyone's skin tone, and they are great for a busy schedule. It is easy to place them all into a pretty cosmetic jar or even a drawer for quick access.<br />They come nicely packaged and are more than worthy of gifting to any makeup lover. I would absolutely recommend these!",5
"The Builder Nail Gels Kit in Clear & Pink is medium to semi thin ~ especially if it is used in warm temperatures. It is nothing like polygel, though it includes a slip solution. The clear is really clear and the pink is nice, also, though I don't use colors a lot. This applies so easily for me, cures as expected, and looks great. I am even able to build an apex.<br />The brush and other accessories are sub-par, like what most inexpensive sets have. They will do well for a newbie, until they figure out if they like the process. Then, they can replace them with better quality items.<br />The slip solution is confusing to be in a builder gel kit, though I find it great for wiping the sticky layer off the nails after application. It can also be used to clean the brush handle, and any other sticky places.<br />I am more than happy with the quality, viscosity, and end results I achieve with this builder gel. You also get a large amount of product to work with. It will last me a while. I love working with it, and would definitely recommend it!",5
"This Hydro-Plumping Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a simple, yet a powerhouse serum. It has wonderful moisturizing, anti-aging, antioxidant, and calming ingredients that are top notch. There are several types of super moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid. It also has Green Tea, which is proven to be an excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial superstar.<br />This is a wonderful serum to use during your day or night routine. I like to apply it to damp, or well hydrated skin. Usually after applying a few layers of my toner. It applies and absorbs easily, and a little does go a long way. Any slight tackiness is taken care of after applying a good moisturizer to help lock in all the good stuff. It has a very light, hardly noticeable scent.<br />It really hydrates my skin and plumps my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looks and feels better when using it. I have combination skin, but use Retin-A, which can be a bit drying and sometimes irritating. This serum really calms the irritation, yet enhances the anti-aging effects of the Retin-A.<br />This serum is a great every day serum. Especially for those who have sensitive and/or dry skin, but is beneficial for any skin type. It has great ingredients, and is not loaded with harsh chemicals, and provides so much good stuff for your skin. It is a simple, yet powerful serum. Highly recommended.<br /><br />The stars of this serum are:<br /><br />~Antioxidant: Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate<br />~Skin-identical ingredient: Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin<br />~Soothing: Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract<br /><br />Simple, yet super ingredients!<br /><br />Other Ingredients:<br /><br />~Buffering: Sodium Hydroxide<br />~Chelating: Sodium Phytate<br />~Emollient: Lecithin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract<br />~Emulsifying: Lecithin<br />~Moisturizer/humectant: Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin<br />~Perfuming: Benzyl Alcohol<br />~Preservative: Benzyl Alcohol, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid<br />~Solvent: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol<br />~Viscosity controlling: Benzyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Carbomer",5
"I really loved the idea of this Boiess Baby Cologne ""Les Enfants"" in White Blossom. Not because I think it is a good idea for a baby, because boy, is it not. I actually thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the Lavanda and the White Blossom scents.<br />Both of the ""Cologne"" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, much less any baby, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. If I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe or not, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived. This is also very expensive ""Cologne"" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it.  <br />For others this ""Baby Cologne"" may be something wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.",3

"This is a great sampler set by KRISNICE. You get a black polish to use as a base or on its own, a couple of color changing polishes, a couple of cat eye polishes, and a sparkly red polish. They are all beautiful and the effects all work well. The cat eyes do require a few coats to get good coverage, and a bit of practice with the magnet to get a good design. The good thing about those are, you can always swipe through the design and start over till you get something you like, and then cure. I love the color changing ones the best, but they only show two toned on longer nails. Otherwise, they just change from one color to another, which is still pretty.<br />The huge thing about this company's sets that I don't like, is they are not labeled. Yes, you get stickers to swatch, but they don't stick! You end up having to glue them on or make other swatches. I really wish they would label or swatch the bottles. I'm starting to not get polish from brands that don't label. It's just such a hassle.<br />Overall, I love all the colors and effects. You can really come up with some unique nail designs with this set. I love the color change with one layer of the purple cat eye over top. This is a good mix and a lot of fun! I would recommend",4
"The straight razor (shavette) I received is far from being professional quality nor could it be an heirloom that can be passed down in the family. It is made from cheap materials and has several defects.<br />The clasp is so thinly made, that it is easily bent just from disengaging it from the spine.  There is a gouge on one spine that goes in on one side and out on the other. And, the razor blade does not stay seated properly once clasped. The wooden scales are not neatly finished. The blades that come with it are not the snap kind. They are full double sided blades, making them more dangerous to have to cut them without getting cut. They are also very thin and cheap. There's no way I can shave a neck, sideburns, facial hair, etc., with this defective razor.<br />I could have overlooked cosmetic issues regarding a razor of this price point. It is the physical defects that hindered its use that are major problems for me.<br />I contacted the seller, but was told that I could keep the defective product, and ""we recommend another straight for you, better than that one in your hand"", and I was given the asin number, so I could purchase it. This was not only poor Customer Service, but a lack of confidence in this, their own product. If they don't recommend this razor, I certainly don't either. It really could have gone much better.",2
"This Belle polygel kit is a great starter set from beginner to expert levels. It has some beautiful neutral colors, along with a white, and gorgeous glitters. They are all half ounce size tubes that will create a few sets of nails each, or you can mix and match the colors to make them go farther.<br />This kit includes; Six .5 oz. polygel colors, primer, gel base and top coats, a nail strengthener, cuticle oil, slip solution, dual forms, polygel brush with spatula, nail clips, and alcohol wipes. It comes nicely packaged in a lovely black box with cutouts to hold everything in place.<br />At minimum, you will need to supply your nail prep and finishing tools and liquids, such as: cuticle pusher and possibly nippers, a buffer, and nail dehydrator/alcohol, but these are things you will want to keep in good supply, anyways.<br />This polygel is so easy to work with. It is not too hard nor too soft. It's very easily workable with the provided slip solution. Even a beginner will have no trouble using it. Just remember, that if your surrounding temperature gets too cold or too hot, it affects the viscosity of the polygel, so work in a room that feels nice.<br />I did two nail swatches; one solid glitter and the other a French manicure with a shimmery twist. As I said, the polygel applied so easily, it also cured as expected without any problems, and the end results turned out beautiful.<br />I have to say that when I received my Belle polygel kit, there was a small issue with my order. I contacted their customer service and was met with such kindness and prompt service. They answered all my questions very quickly and respectfully. They're promptness in solving my problem, and their patience in dealing with my questions, shows me that they really care about their customers. Knowing that they were not privy to my customer status lets me know that they will treat all customers the same.<br />The colors are all so beautiful, and the glitters really make a statement. This set would make a great addition to anyone's collection and would also make a wonderful gift. Knowing this polygel kit is also backed by Belle, a wonderful company who really values their customers, makes a great product even better. I would most definitely recommend it!",5
"I love how this Essence has such soothing and hydrating ingredients. I've just recently started using K-beauty products, but the first one I tried left my skin very irritated. This one feels so light, but moisturizing. I'm just learning about a lot of the ingredients that are in most Korean beauty products, and I'm also Learning that some of them do not do well with my skin. This one works wonderfully for me. I use Retin-A, so anything really harsh or very exfoliating is too much. The first one made my skin very red, swollen, and angry looking. This one feels very nice on my skin and I love the way my skin is looking and feeling now. I would definitely recommend it! Especially, for those using Retin-A or those with very sensitive skin.",5
"using this set for about a week now and I love it. It really makes a difference in how my skin feels. It's plumper, much softer and smoother, and well hydrated. It's not heavy or greasy and sinks easily into my skin. I'm so glad that I got to try the skin softener and the cream. They work very well together and with my other products, as well. I look forward to trying other products by this brand. Definitely recommend!",5
"This is my first experience trying anything with snail mucin in it and also some of the other ingredients, like peptides and adenosine. I can't say which one it is for sure, but I suspect it's the snail mucin that made a noticeable and immediate difference in my skin.<br />My forehead skin has a few dimples and I have some fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes. I am 50 years old, but I've been using Retin-A for several years now. I've had a mostly natural skin care routine, other than the Retin-A, but recently decided to try a few of the K-beauty products out. This one was the first I used, and with the first use I can see my forehead and wrinkles were much smoother, along with the rest of my skin, as well. It also gave my skin a brighter look. With each use, it just gets better and better.<br />A little definitely goes a long way. Its texture is slimy, but I've found that I only need a very small amount to cover my face, and it massages in so easily. I also apply it to my neck & decollete.<br />I'm so glad that I tried this, and now I will just keep adding to it until I get the full K-beauty routine down. I would gladly purchase this again and I highly recommend it!",5
"I don't have an uneven skin tone on my face, but I do on my decollete area. I'm using this serum there instead of on my face, and I love the consistency and how well it sinks into my skin. I also love the pump bottle that keeps it fresh and free from contaminants. It does have an odd scent, but it doesn't linger long. Once I add my moisturizer, I don't notice it anymore. I haven't been using it long enough to notice a big difference yet, but my skin does feel smoother and softer overall. I would recommend it.",4
"I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!",5
"I've used this brand's dip powders and thought they were great, so I wanted to give their liquids a try, as the powders did not come with them. I did two nail swatches, and before I was finished with the second one the base coat brush had dried almost completely out. It's unusable until cleaned. The top coat brush was also drying out.<br />Luckily a different brand sends several brushes along with their sets, and they actually fit these bottles. It would have been nice if this company had sent along extra brushes. A brush cleaner would have been nice, also. If I didn't have extra brushes, I would just be out of luck.<br />I've used so many dip liquids and have done so many dip nail sets, and this is the first time I've ever had a brush dry out. That doesn't make me feel good about using these liquids. I think I will stick with those that I know won't dry out.",3
"This is a nice acrylic brush. It has a pretty pattern on the handle and the bristles are nice and straight. Though this #8 brush is smaller than all of my other #8 brushes, it works very well when applying acrylics. Whenever I get a new brush, I always do a burn test on a few of the bristle strands. The bristles in this brush are some kind of natural fiber or fur, but I can't say that it's a Kolinsky Sable, as true Kolinsky Sable is usually much more expensive. The bristles are rather short, leaving me to wonder how well the brush will hold up in the long run, but it should last a while..<br />Overall this is a nice acrylic nail brush, that has a very pretty pattern on its handle. It works well when applying acrylics, and I've had no problems with bristle loss. I would recommend this brush to those who are just starting out or those looking for a good budget brush.",4
"After going over the ingredients in these products, the only two I would feel even remotely safe using would be this shampoo and conditioner. As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I ""might"" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe. I absolutely would not recommend it!",2
"The name of these masks really throws you off. It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.",4
"This is only my second time using a face mask, and this one was a much better experience than the last. I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br />For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br />There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for about an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br />The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for about 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me. I would definitely recommend this mask, but would also recommend starting with less time than I did if you have combination to oily skin.",4
"This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.",3
"These are good quality thick amber colored bottles, and they arrived very well packed. I love that they come with a funnel, labels, marking pen, a dropper, and screw top lids along with the sprayer tops. They work great for making my witch hazel facial toner spray and colloidal silver spray. The sprayers work pretty well, although the sprayer part spins around freely. It makes them feel a little clumsy and uneasy to grab hold of. The price for these is on the high side of what I would normally pay for a set like this. Aside from those couple things, they are very nice quality bottles that come with lots of goodies.",4
"First, I will say these oils seem fine. They work well together or apart, mixed into other skincare products or alone. I use these types of oils to make my own facial oil mix or to add to my moisturizer.<br />The thing I absolutely hate that companies do to try to sell their products is to say things that aren't true. The USDA does not certify oils - food, cosmetic, or otherwise. The fact that the bottle says this product is USDA certified on one side, and the other side says not intended for ingestion should speak volumes. The USDA certifies and regulates the welfare and production of food products; meaning products that you ingest. So, why on earth would they certify a product you cannot ingest? The bottle also makes outright claims of known cures from using these oils. There is no disclaimer on either bottle that states that these claims have not been approved or proven by the FDA, or whatever the disclaimer is that is mandatory. There are ingredients listed, one ingredient for each product, the oil, and that's it. Nothing tells how these oils were extracted. Therefore, we do not know if they are refined or unrefined. They probably don't know either. So you see, therein lies the lies and deception.<br />These oils would be much better if they weren't tied to lies. Because you know what they say about lies... if you tell one you have to tell more to keep up with the first one. Is what they say in the bottle really what's in the bottle? Are they pure oils or mixed with a lesser oil? Oils are greasy. If they are unrefined, why aren't they greasy? When you refine oils, you take away a lot of their natural properties and their nutritive value, is that why they aren't greasy? Because of the lies and lack of important information, I really don't know for sure what these oils are.<br />Because of the deceptive practices and claims made, I would not recommend these or any of their other oils.",2
"These travel-size bottles are really nice. I love that they are a larger size so that I can use them for hand sanitizer and facial care products. The ones for hand sanitizer can easily fit in my handbag and carry bag, and the ones for my facial care products fit nicely on the small caddy I have in my bathroom. They are easy to fill from my large pump containers, which is a plus. My only issue is that mine are missing the clips that go on them. It's not so terrible for the few that I use in my bathroom, but it is for the ones I use for hand sanitizer. It makes it harder to find them in my purse and bag. Hopefully, no one else has this problem. I would definitely recommend them if you get the clips.",3
"I already had a large water flosser but was looking for something smaller and liked the idea of a rechargeable one. Upon first opening this flosser, it's very unique and different and would be great for traveling. The way the pieces of it fit together so compactly into each other, and then into a very nice fabric zip case with a handle, definitely sets this flosser apart.<br />When I used it, I found that it did not have near the amount of pressure that I'm used to from my other flosser. As nice as it is, it didn't feel as if it was cleaning between my teeth very well. I felt it gave a nice surface clean, but the pressure of the water was not enough to force out any particles from in between my teeth.<br />The flosser is also extremely loud. I've had the one I'm using for quite a while, and though it makes some noise, it isn't loud enough to hear from a couple of rooms away with the door shut. This one was scary loud. I'm not sure if it may have a defect or not, so others may not have this problem.<br />For me, this flosser does not have enough power behind it, and it is just too loud for my liking. I really wanted to like it, but it's not for me. I hope that others have a better experience than I did. 3.75 Stars ✨",4
"This is a nice kit for someone who is just starting out, who has a little patience to work with a semi-difficult gel. It has everything you need to create poly gel nails aside from the UV light. It is a little on the sticky side, but I find using a good quality hand sanitizer instead of the slip solution makes it a lot easier. All the colors cure very nicely, aside from the white. It does take a bit longer. And, I love that the clear is clear. It's nice that you get some glitters, along with the poly gel, to experiment with a bit of nail art to see if you like doing your nails at home, before investing a lot of money in supplies. Overall, I think this is a good budget starter kit if one has a bit of patience. 4 stars ✨",4
"Wow! This set comes with so many different types of butterflies. I love how the butterfly stickers come in so many different colors that no matter what color polish should you choose to wear, there are so many butterflies that will go with it. Some of my favorite ones are the butterfly outlines that are shiny or holographic. Most of the color ones also shimmer, which is so beautiful.<br />I like that there are butterflies that are flying sideways and also complete butterflies. It gives nail art a lot more interest. Having the glitter butterflies is a bonus to play around with encapsulating. With this sticker and glitter kit, there are so many nail art designs you can create. I've done several, but my mind is filled with endless possibilities. Highly recommended! 5 stars ✨",5
"In this kit, you get a nice set to complete a French tip design. You get 30 ml of each color, which is a wonderful size. You also get a base and topcoat, an application tool, and a couple of glitters. This would make the perfect kit if it didn't have a few issues.<br />So far, I've only used the clear and white poly gels to create a French tip design. They are a bit tackier than I would like them to be, which makes them harder to work with. They also take quite a bit longer to fully cure under an LED UV light than most other poly gels. I did use tips and dual forms. When I remove the dual forms after curing them for 60 seconds on top and bottom, they were still tacky on top. I had to cure them for another 30 seconds. My nails only lasted a little over a week before starting to lift around the edges. This is hardly a long-lasting poly gel, in my opinion.<br />I'm a still licensed but retired nail technician, so I am very well aware and knowledgeable on how to prep nails properly. User error was not the problem. These gels would be good for practice, but if you are looking for a poly gel that will last for more than a week, you may want to look at another brand. 3.5 Stars ✨",4
"When I saw these I was so excited because they match most of my wardrobe. I'm always wearing my hair up and love wearing skinny hard headbands with ponytails to keep straggly hairs back. I thought this would be something new to try altogether.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this fabric is awful to wear in your hair. I am a seamstress and it is definitely synthetic and feels like it. It's slippery, hot, and doesn't' feel nice at all. The design seems like an afterthought, as it will not stay in place.<br /><br />So, I've had a big change of plans! I will be using these during my skincare routine and putting on my makeup. At least these headbands will get some use. I'm constantly losing the ones I have, so now I have plenty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3.5 stars for effort and couldn't bear to recommend them. Sorry.",4
"This was my first experience with poly gel, and I can't say that it was an easy and straightforward one. I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy, I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro ""lift proof"" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars ✨ for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.",4
"This was my first magnetic eyeliner and eyelash kit. The eyeliner works great and the lashes adhere very well. The eyelashes themselves are beautiful and I love the lengths. The liner is easy to put on and so are the lashes. And, they stay on very well, with one exception.<br /><br />The eyelashes are too wide for my eyes, and I need to cut the last magnet off for them to fit properly. But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible. <br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end, close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara. They just need another magnet!",3
"I have dry eyes, and these work great for using saline solution to clean around my eyes everyday several times. They're thin and soft, and just the right size, so that I don't feel like I'm wasting a large cotton round. I also use them to go over my face with witch hazel, after my nightly facial cleansing. It only takes one for each task. I haven't had any problems with them falling apart or being too thin for my needs. Using them for my purposes, the three pack has & will last me for a pretty long time.<br />It's nice to find the right size product for the right size need that I have. I highly recommend these to anyone who has light duty needs for cotton rounds, and doesn't want to feel like they're wasting money, and throwing away the majority of a product, because it was just too large for what they needed it for. We have enough trash in landfills.",4
"I'm really on a kick of trying the whole OZ line...and I am in love with all of it. In fact, I find a way to use every serum over two days. I use Retin A every other night and use the vitamin c serum after using it. The next night, I use the Vitamin c with AHA and the Hyaluronic acid serums along with this one. I do wait about 10-15 minuites between each. But, I use the eye gel every night. They all work so well together and my skin is looking and feeling so much better. My biggest problems are large pores and uneven texture. My texture has evened out so much and my pores are surprising me more each day. I'd say these serums really have made the biggest difference in my pores. I kept seeing my grandmother's nose in the mirror, and I'm only 46--I was really self conscious. I'm starting to like looking in the mirror now...I'm seeing pretty quick changes and I like them.",5
"It's an excellent long-lash mascara and it can be easily paired with other mascara fixers from Korean brands. As some bloggers said, it DOES irritate eyes a little and it is extremely hard to remove. So if you want to buy this, buy oily lip/eye cleanser together. In terms of mascara, it's an excellent mascara. It does not make your lashes spidery or so, and make the lashes curly, defined and longer for a whole day. I have tried multiple mascaras from Chanel, Lancome, and many Korean brands, but I think this mascara is still the best.",4
"This is a great kit at a great value. I had a colored uv polish already but didn’t have the base coat or top coat, so this is just what I needed. It also had instructions, which had some helpful tips if you’re not used to doing your nails. The only thing I didn’t like was that the polish was super thick - so thick it was hard to get an even layer on my nails without getting a huge gloop of it.",5
I usually use one of those thick coconut milk cleansers and I don’t usually like foaming ones. This one was good though. It feels nice and soothing on my skin - not harsh or drying like some foaming ones. It has a little bit of scent to it but not enough that I really notice if I’m not thinking about it.,5
"If I could give these six stars I would. I was in the middle of purchasing a man scape replacement blade and saw that the Amazon vine program had one as a sample. This is not a paid review and not forced to give 5 stars.<br /><br />They are identical as the official manscaped blade which is the reason I test tried them. It cuts the exact same way and pretty much identical to the original. Best part is that you get two of them.<br /><br />Generally, they recommend replacing the blades every three months, but I've used my original 1 for over six months and as long as you clean the blade, wash it, as well as removing any hairs the buildup inside the original machine or on the blade itself one should last you about the same. Considering you get two of them for $20 (at the time of writing this review 4/20/2022)  its a great deal.<br /><br />I was getting ready to shave my chest and armpits and waited for the blades to get delivered. They cut identical as the original. You can either use it as a beard/face trimmer to keep very light stubble that is under a five o'clock shadow or simply use it to cut your chest hair or under the armpit for a closer shave.",5
"I put this on my body, hands and legs after a shower. It has nice fragrance and the feel of the oil on my skin is wonderful. I am used to the regular body lotions such as Dove, Nivea and St. Ives, all with water base, but this ""oily"" product is a welcome change. It feels very soft and silky and the skin does not itch. It is therapeutic for someone who has dry skin. I usually put every day in the morning after shower, and do not feel itchy all day. This is a nice alternative to water based body lotions.",5
"I really like this pencil, but the color, gray brown, was too dark for me and I couldn't use it. As there was no other color that would be better, I can't buy this product; however, if you can find a good color for you the quality and ease of application is wonderful.<br />I also recommend that they stamp the name of the company on the actual pencil so that if I ever wanted to buy it again I would know how to do that. Right now, the pencil that has no writing, only the color number 04 at the bottom.",4
"This lotion would get five stars, but I think it’s expensive for what it is and the container is definitely not user-friendly.<br />If it had been in a tube it would have gotten four stars from me.<br />The lotion itself is very thick and emollient. It is gentle and has virtually no fragrance.<br />But getting it out of the plastic bottle with a difficult to use top meant squeezing really hard. More work than I want for a bit of moisturizer.",3
"As they sent me the shampoo, this review is for that.<br />I think it’s excellent quality and has a super leather. It cleaned my hair beautifully and left it fairly soft, but that was with a rinse out conditioner, too.<br />I would highly recommend it.",5
"I have been using this eye cream for months, day and night, and just adore it. It’s very emollient without being greasy at all.<br /><br />I am usually sensitive to products and this gave me no negative reactions.<br /><br />It only takes a tiny little bit to moisturize my upper and lower lids. Of course, I stay away from the eyelash area as I don’t want any of this in my eyes.<br /><br />One jar has lasted for months.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like is the container as it means sticking my finger into it and I really don’t like that delivery system. I would vastly prefer if it had a small nozzle tube that could stand on its end. I know it wouldn’t look as fancy, but it would be far more user friendly.",5
"This was pretty impossible to use. It was so dry and hard that it wouldn’t even apply color to my brow. I<br />I would strongly suggest going with the Maybelline brow precise or the Maybelline brow ultra slim. Both of those are phenomenal and fairly priced. I think you can get them with Amazon’s subscribe and save, too.",1
"A tiny spritz of this not only holds my hair, but makes it look fuller.<br />I imagine it will last a long time; so, its also a great value.<br />I was always loath to try these freeze-type hairsprays, thinking they would look stiff, but this doesn’t.<br />No discernible fragrance, either.",5
"I really loved the modern look of these clippers and file; however, i took one star away as the small nail file is not as sharp as I would have liked. I'm used to an old Revlon diamond file that works much faster.<br />As others have said, you can very easily remove the black base on the nail clippers if it seems unwieldy to you. It felt just fine to me.",4
"Great color selection.  One for every mood or outfit. Very effective product. I have baby fine hair, but a lot of it.  These work very well.",5
"Best bathing cloth ever.  This is such a satisfying exfoliating cloth, and is the perfect size.  You will need much less soap to get a great lather from these.",5
"Will never use any other cloth again.  It leaves your skin feeling like a baby's.  Holds so much more body cleanser, too.",5
This roller works great with my body oils.  It dispenses just enough while smoothly gliding over your skin.  I find that putting it in the refrigerator before applying gives the roller a nice cooling effect.<br /><br />The only issue is that the bottle leaks a little when using and should always remain upright.,4
"Unique and well designed, but there is no way that these are extra large shower caps.  They are average in size at best.  They are cute and adjustable, but not an extra large.",4
"Pros:<br /><br />Very cute and compact facial massager in the shape of a lipstick tube.  It comes with a USB cable.  The massager charges very quickly for immediate use.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I feel that the massager is a little weak to actually work.  I feel most of the vibration at the base of the product, and not much at the tip.  Also, the heating element of this product is very weak.  It barely gets warm.",3
"Let's start out by explaining that I have longer (waist length), fine hair, but a lot of it.  Nothing stays in my hair.  It tangles like a beast.  I've pretty much been living with my hair in a braid for the last year because it is the only thing I can do that doesn't end up in a huge mess but also mostly stays-well, except for all the frizzies and flyaways that sneak out.  So I was looking for another fast alternative to get my hair back and out of my face that also wouldn't require an hour of brushing to undo.<br />These were cheap, and Amazon is always so great about returns, that I decided to give it ago.  I figured, at worse, at least it would be a simple-ish way to pull my hair back when I am working at the computer.  And they are.  20 seconds and my hair is back in a bun without the discomfort of lots of other hair styles.  I mean, they are actually surprisingly comfortable.<br />But what I did not expect is for them to hold so well!  I put my hair in a high bun yesterday then went for a run.  I had fully intended to take the bun out and put my hair in a braid, because there was no way this thing would hold through a run, but IT DID!  7 miles later, my bun was still secure and tight, but comfortable and looked as good (which honestly wasn't that good to begin with) as it did when I first put it up.  I could not believe it held through the entire run.<br />In all honesty, they are a bit fussy to use, and I have not perfected making it look like a perfect doughnut bun.  But I'm not looking for winning style awards.  I just wanted a simple way to get my hair up and back that would hold for a few hours. And in that aspect I got way more than I bargained for.<br />Very impressed, very pleased, very glad I took a chance!",5
"I am a 54 yr old woman with the kinkiest, frizziest hair you have ever seen!  This product has made my hair so soft, manageable and shiny that I wish I had discovered sooner!  It is wonderful!!!",5
"These are gorgeous brushes!  I was not expecting the amount of sparkle on the handles (metal). I am not a profession makeup artist, but simply a casual (light but daily) makeup wearer that needs some brushes for powder and eyeshadow.  These are soft but full and brush hairs have not fallen out.  They work well for my needs with the added bonus of making me smile when I see them sparkle.",5
"I have been hearing about Rosemary oil for a long time thus I got this product. I tried this on my husbands hair/scalp. It was not too greasy like the other oil for hair growth that he used. In fact, it is a little watery and lightweight and dries out easily. I had to pour more as I apply it to the rest of his scalp unlike the products which he previously used where a tiny amount would do. As to the scent, we both like it. As for the effectiveness, I have to update on this as it has been just 4 days since he started using this to tell any difference. Also, he didn't develop any itchiness on his scalp.",3
I got these for my daughter in law. She said they are very well made and a great quality. They work really well and are a great value for how many you get.,5
"I really like this mascara. It definitely lengthens my lashes. It’s creamier than any others I’ve had, and goes on really smooth. There was absolutely no clumping and it made my lashes look feathery. I’m not sure about being waterproof. I didn’t test that out.",5
"Herbs Botanica Alum Powder offers a multi-certified, coarse alum that is good for general use but not what you might expect for a powder.<br /><br />PROS<br />• Appropriate for multiple uses<br />• USDA Organic, vegan, and other certifications<br />• Bag includes recipes for use<br />• Double-packaged with a bag of the alum inside of a paper, resealable bag<br />• Decent value of level of quality<br /><br />CONS<br />• Often, alum is ground to a fine powder. At least half of this alum, however, is like what you would expect of coarse sea salt—not a powder, as described. Get out the mortar and pestle, and you shouldn’t have any trouble making a fine powder for deodorant mixtures, dying, and other common uses. This downside is not significant enough for me to strip away a star, but buyers should be aware of the coarser-than-usual alum.",5
So much easier than a cosmetics bag. Simply on snap and open the flap. All of your brushes are now laying there and easy to access!!<br /><br />The clear plastic should easily wipe up/clean overtime.  The trim is made of white which I suspect we’ll get dingy with make up with US. Would you prefer a different color to not sure wear.<br /><br />Great concept if you have a lot of cosmetic brushes and tools!,5
"I should have read the description more closely instead of looking at the first few photos.  I thought the device came with something inside that you freeze and apply to the face.  The online photos show a flower inside.  What the device is in reality is a plastic container that you fill with water, take the lid off and roll on your face.<br /><br />Easy to use ✅<br /><br />Soft durable plastic ✅<br /><br />Washes/cleans easily ✅<br /><br />Helps with swelling/puffiness  ✅<br /><br />Online photos suggest adding ingredients to your water before freezing such as roses for skin whitening. Very skeptical a rose in ice will whiten my skin.  👎<br /><br />Gets messy as the ice melts.  👎",3
Good product.  Comes with detailed instructions on how to use. The directions are accurate.<br /><br />Do not buy this product unless you have an UV light.  I tried using without a UV light out of curiosity. The first polish in the process would not cure without the UV light. FYI.<br /><br />Easy to use and does dry fast with a UV light. Definite advantage.<br /><br />Gel polish is much harder to remove which is good and bad.  Good because it lasts longer but bad when you need to remove.<br /><br />Great price point!,4
These hair clips are adorable!<br /><br />They arrive in a cute gift box.  Presentation is everything and they did a good job with this one.  This product would make an excellent birthday gift for a young girl or a stocking stuffer.<br /><br />The clips easily go in and out of the hair.  They are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The colors of the stones are exactly the colors shown in the online photos.  There is no misrepresentation.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these for the $$.,5
Hair was of good quality and easy to use,5
one of the very best~top five for price tyTYty,5
"[[VIDEOID:d4ce3b11e013e715a72f58191c41086d]] I like the size of this brush. I also like how the bristles seem softer than other brushes. My dog doesn’t really care to be brushed ever, but he does not seem to mind this one as much as he minds the other ones.",5
"These manage to be very generic looking.  Which is fine, but interesting that I could notice considering it's just a toothbrush head.  They just don't have the decorative banding on them that some of the others have (they do have the color band for distinguishing between multiple users).  What I don't like is that they do not have the plastic shields with them, although even the originals don't have that anymore.  As my remaining shield gets cracked further and further, I wonder how I will continue to travel with my brush.<br /><br />These seem basically the same as the originals.  It's sort of hard to say if my perception that they are just a tad less good is based on something substantial or just aesthetics and packaging.  If the price is right, they're worth a try.",4
"(Wife) Is a very beautiful and complete set of brushes and a silicone device to clean them after each use or when you think is necessary. Is perfect for a gift, it comes in a cute bag in a box easy to wrap of just put in a gift bag. The bristles are very soft and gentle on your skin. It also has a cover to keep them nice and tight so it doesn't lose its shape.",5
This is wonderful and replaces counter clutter.,5
"This little tool is going to see many types of use in my home. I suffer from migraines, so cold therapy is my go to for those. In addition to headaches, we also have out share of muscle aches and bumps and bruises. This tool will be great for giving those localized attention without the bulk of an ice pack. We can also control the pressure applied.<br /><br />The two heads are easily popped on and off. It's nice that you get two, because you can always have a spare in the freezer, and switch them out when needed. This is also going to be a great cool down tool for my husband after doing yardwork. The Texas sun is brutal in the summertime. Applying this to his face and the back of his neck is going to be a real treat. I think that with the multiple uses this provides, it's worth grabbing one.",5
"This is a small jar of very smooth cream. It applies very easily and comfortably on the skin, but it does have a really off-putting scent, for me. I'm not sure what the smell is but I find it to be really unpleasant. But the mask itself does leave skin very soft, which I appreciate. I find that sleeping masks don't always work well for me, because I'm a side sleeper with a lot of sleep disturbance issues. So I end up wiping my face on my pillow all night through shifting and trying to get comfortable, and emollient sleep masks may not really get to do their full thing on my skin at night. Still, this mask does get points for how moisturizing it is, and for how it softens the skin.",4
The headband is not too thick. It is just right for an outdoor walk in colder weather. The size is right and it doesn’t feel tight or loose on the head. It covers the ears. I recommend it,5
"This is a unique product idea with a face oil and a face cream in one container. The two products are dispensed together via one pump, then mixed as you apply to your face. It feels good on my skin, providing a lot of moisturizing without feeling greasy, even on my combination skin. It does, however, have a much stronger scent than I like; I prefer my face products to be unscented.",4
"The bristles on the mascara wand were too long for my liking. As for the mascara itself, it’s very thin, almost kind of runny, and I found it didn’t do much for my lashes. It didn’t seem to cling to my lashes. I kept applying more coats, but still didn’t see great results. This one isn’t for me.",2
"These types of paw washing cups are an excellent way to clean muddy paws. I’m so glad the days of lugging a bucket of water are behind me. I’ve tried a couple different versions and found this one to be good, if it fits your dog’s paws.<br />I have a golden retriever. The box I received said “medium” and it works for her, though it’s a little tight. There are a lot of silicone bristles inside and while that’s good for cleaning, if you’re on the borderline of it fitting your dog, too many bristles make it difficult to get your dog’s paws in and out and to agitate the cup enough to clean. I didn’t see a size noted when I ordered, so I’m not quite sure if it’s possible to order different sizes since I don’t see that info on the Amazon page, just on the box I received.<br />Cleaning the cup is easy - just rinse if the water isn’t too dirty or unscrew the top and remove the silicone bristle insert for a deeper clean.<br />The included towel is nice and fluffy, but only the size of a standard washcloth. My dogs feet come out pretty wet, so the cloth is soaked by the time I’m done wiping her feet. I use a towel instead.",4
"I’ve used a number of different salt scrubs and love them for how soft they leave my skin feeling after a shower. This one is a little chunkier than most and feels rougher on my skin. It is also quite oily. I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don’t even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using. It does leave my skin feeling smooth and provided you like coconut, the scent is nice.",4
"I love the smell of this conditioner so was eager to try it. Unfortunately, it did almost nothing for my hair. I have thick, curly hair and require a lot of conditioner. I used the same amount of this Taza conditioner as I would any other, and it was strange in that it felt like I hadn’t put anything on my hair. There was no silky feel, I could not comb my fingers through may hair. I enjoyed the scent, but my hair felt as if I hadn’t put any conditioner on it. I tried adding more, but it didn’t help. I ended up rinsing it and using a different conditioner. If your hair doesn’t require much conditioning, this may work for you, but if your hair is anything like mine, this probably isn’t for you.",2
"I’ve been trying out a couple of different lash serums over the past month. With my husband also using it (on his brows), while I use it on my lashes, we’ve been able to try different brands to see if there are any differences in results. This serum, by Kimuse, is very similar to the others in consistency (a thin liquid) and in how it’s applied (with a very thin brush). I have had no negative reactions to the serum, and no irritation to my eyes even when I’ve slipped and gotten some in my eye. This serum boasts results in as little as 3-4 weeks, while most others are more conservative at 6 weeks. In the few weeks we’ve been using the serums, neither of us have noticed any dramatic changes as far as lash or brow growth, but I do think I’m losing fewer lashes which is a definite plus. Honestly, I’m not sure if any serum is going to provide dramatic results, but we’ll continue for at least a few more weeks and see what happens while hoping for the best.Hopefully, I’ll be back with exciting news!<br /><br />Update: After using this, as well as other, lash growth serums for several months, I have noticed a definite improvement in the length of my lashes. I have not noticed as significant an improvement in the thickness, or volume, of my lashes, however. I believe that these types of serums do help promote growth, and I haven't been able to detect much difference between brands except that a couple of them irritated my eyes. Therefore, my conclusion is that this is helpful and the real determination of what works best will be what's most comfortable for you to use, so read the ingredients and watch for any possible allergy triggers or irritants.",4
"When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.”  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",4
"This is a thick, rich cream that, for me, has worked wonders on dry, scaly skin. My hands needed some serious help and after using this cream for just a few days, I have seen much improvement. My skin is much soft, the cracks are disappearing, and they feel moisturized. The cream is thick, a little goes a long way, and I’ve found it’s best to really rub it in, not list skim it over the skin and leave it. I have also been using the cream on a particularly itchy patch of skin on my back, again, with excellent results.<br />There is no scent.<br />The cream is made from several natural ingredients, most notably Manuka honey from New Zealand, something new to me, but that has been used for centuries in New Zealand. I’m glad it made its way to me in the USA!",5
"This pillow is soft and comfy and makes for a relaxing bath. I love the soft fabric that covers the pillow, such an improvement over the plastic pillow I had been using. With six suction cups, it stays in place in my free-standing tub, and it’s just the right size to cradle my head and also cushion my upper back. There is an attached hook to hang the pillow to dry when done bathing. Included with the pillow are a tool to loosen the suction cups from the tub, a storage bag, and a bag of rose petals for your first bath with the new pillow. A very nice pillow!",5
"I like the silicone brush, it’s soft and scrubs without scratching.  I wish it comes off, was kinda weird holding the whole bottle to scrub my face.<br />The cleanser looks and smells like unscented liquid soap.  It is like cleaning my face with foaming hand soap. It left it squeaky clean, which is nice. Takes away all the excess oil and grime and makeup.  My skin felt tight afterwards.<br />I don’t know about the hydrating part as I always follow washing my face with aloe Vera gel. I have oily, sensitive skin and this didn’t make me breakout.",4
"Smells very mildly of ginger, I smell soap more than anything.  I followed directions and leave it on for 10 minutes before I step in the shower.  The way I use it is to leave it on the sink counter.  I lather it on specific areas and leave it on while I brush my teeth and do other morning routines.  It feels like a clean bar of soap.  After a week, no noticeable slimming, but those areas feel clean and less bloated.",3
It is cooling on the skin when I apply it.  Smells like winter mint gum.  Takes a lot of rubbing for it to fully absorb and leaves a slightly oily sheen on my skin.,3
"The kit comes with a spatula which makes it easy to spread the mask, mine broke during the first use.  I waited 30 minutes to let it dry.  It peeled off like charred paper stuck to my skin.  My face felt very clean and smooth, though it didn't remove all the blackheads after one use.  The aloe gel felt refreshing on my skin.<br />Overall, a nice kit for facial cleansing.",3
"It comes with 24 different stencils (you'll have to flip the same stencil over for left/right eyebrows), which are for eyebrows that are a little over 2 inches in length.  I tried a few that are close to my eyebrow shape and thickness (or thinness), but my eyebrows are a little too weird and short.<br />It took quite a bit of effort to transfer the color from the tube to my brows/skin.  The end result is okay.<br />It comes with a double ended brush to help with applying and fixing the color and shape, so that helps.",3
"I don't think there are any creams that would make eyebags disappear.  I just look for ones that would reduce the feeling of puffiness.  For that, I'd give this 5 stars.  But it does not reduce wrinkles, eyebags, etc., which is what it claims, so I gave it 3 stars.<br />I use it in the morning and in the evening, after washing my face.<br />It feels cool when applied, and doesn't cause any irritation.  It also doesn't give me eye crusts.  There is no smell.  It doesn't have any bad interaction with my makeup either.",3
"Good idea but execution seems a bit off -  after about 3 weeks, the pumice stone came off the handle  and the loofah has lost its shape.  But the brushes and the handle work great and is holding its shape and functionality very well.  A over-the-top note is included in the set - so be aware if this is being gifted.",3
"I ordered this wig, and I am a bit disappointed. The wig sheds quite a bit, feels a bit thinner than the 180% density it promises, and the wig fits people with much bigger heads. The wig does come with the knots already bleached, and it is as long as it stated, but overall this wig just isn't worth the money. I would skip it and wouldn't order again.",3
"Where to start? This set is not water based,  excepting the two glitter gels. Nothing was labeled,  the oil based makeups melted in the package,  the temporary tattoos didn't transfer cleanly,  the stencils were just stickers that didn't stay in place,  and in all,  this product was very disappointing. The only two upsides were the brushes included that were of good quality and the glitter gels that, while covering very thinly, shimmered nicely.  Just don't expect to apply thickly because it just won't happen.  I'd skip this kit.",1
"These khaki brown neutral shadows are a good addition to my makeup palette. My favorite feature of this 6 piece cream eye shadow is that it stays put even when I am sweating. Instead of streaking down my cheeks or blotching in the creases of my eyelids, it really stays on where it is supposed to, especially if I use an eyeshadow primer. The colors are lovely, neutral hues that most people will find complementary to  their skin tone. I have a couple of their eye shadow sets, but this is the one that gets used the most.<br /><br />The pink set is softly feminine with lighter colors to accent daywear. They are perfect for cooler skin tones or as highlights on the eye for warmer tones.",5
"The mask goes on easily with the spatula and dries with a more matte finish to show when it is ready. I could feel it tightening as it dried. It peels off easily where enough is applied, but tends to leave behind the edges, like most of these types of masks do. I like the serum that comes after. I used the mask after taking a hot bath and washing with my regular cleanser to help open the pores, soften any blackheads, and loosen the dead skin. It works well, drying in about 20 minutes. It left my skin feeling soft. I then finished with the serum and enjoyed the selfcare it promotes. A nice addition to my routine.",5
"I used this immediately after showering, two pumps, as stated on the box. Which happens to be in Japanese, so I've added translations for anyone interested. It's good, definitely removes any tight feeling from the skin after a shower or cleansing, but I don't find it to give me any wow factor in my skincare routine. Just another step. It's very lightweight, no artificial scent, and soaks right in.",4
"Love having a space saving tub to soak my feet in. I deal with achy feet at the end of the day due to a hammertoe LOL. Man, y'all just get all the juicy details about my most intimate secrets huh!?<br /><br />Anyway, if you stand on the massagers, OUCH. If you rub your feet back and forth along them, hee hee *Michael Jackson voice* that tickles. Maybe one day I'll be able to have a nice jet powered bubbly one.. are you reading this, my sweet soon to be hubby? Til then.. this will do the job! Plus it came with a pumice and file! Love love love. PS I have wide feet. Size 8. Lots of room..",4
"Oh my GAWWWD! This thing is amazing! This will be a lengthy review, but if you are like me, I hope you'll enjoy the very detailed essay I am about to write for the 2nd time because my original review closed out of the page :(<br /><br />I will preface this by letting you know I have coarse, curly hair. ""bUt hEaThEr, wHat nUmBer aNd pOroSitY aRe YoU?"".<br />I am 3a-c and high porosity. Now, it is storytime LOL, so grab a snack or an adult bev.<br /><br />Let me tell you about the root, no pun intended, of a good portion of my self esteem issues LOL. When I was a kid, I was teased relentlessly about my hair. Ah yes, even Rave/LA Looks gel, with a spritz of White Rain hairspray couldn't tame this! Kids are mean. I ran cross country all through high school, and with many mornings having only an hour to get ready after running until my bunions ached (what the heck heather, TMI!), I eventually learned the only way to keep these people from throwing tiny paper balls in my hair or touching it, was to throw it in a bun. Containment, if you will. That thing was so tight I could hardly think straight. Does that explain my grades lol? So, my hair means a lot to me, y'all!<br /><br />Moving onto the stuff you really want to know, the magical brush I'm in love with💖<br /><br />This brush has what I assume are nylon bristles. The only suggestion I have is to replace them with boar bristles, but it isn't a deal breaker. A few, and I mean 2 or 3, of those bristles came out when I was examining this baby before using it. It has pins and bristles all the way around and up and down. They don't tug at the hair or stretch it to damage or snap damp hair. I did brush my hair out with a wet brush before using, though.<br /><br />The brush is so lightweight, I didn't think it was going to do much lol. Thank you to the manufacturer for making it so lightweight! It was such a breeze to brush the sections of hair. My wrists were happy :)<br /><br />The brush does get hot, but not too hot! I accidentally touched the metal part a few times and I still have all my fingers! Yeehaw! There is a little knob that sticks out, to grasp onto as you roll the brush through your hair. You could probably use a straightening glove too! I have never used a Revlon brush, nor touched one irl. So, take that for what it is, but I've watched A LOT of videos on YouTube with that specific brush. I believe the Revlon is heavier and hotter than this brush. I have heard of some gals smelling burning. I did not experience that. I did use a heat protectant (up to 450°) along with a leave in cream. By the way, there is an air (I assume cool) setting, which is amazing as it is actually regar air! Not semi warm air like some dryers I've used in the past. The low setting is low and the high is faster and hotter. They light up so you know what is what! Love it.<br /><br />Please don't expect this to smooth it out like a flat iron would. This provides the perfect base though, to smooth with a flat iron quickly. It took me from start to finish about 50 mins. Some of that time was spent sectioning and spraying the hair with protectant, as well as doing some house stuff. Realistically it maybe took 40 mins. I did wait after my wash and condition, to let the hair dry a little bit. To about 85%. I even spritzed dry sections with water as needed, so my brush could glide through. I've only used this 2x. Once on wet hair and once for a touch up. I'm hoping to be as good as Julissa Guillen on YouTube, as I use this more :) maybe I'll be faster and it'll be smoother too!<br /><br />I used this before bedtime, so I don't have a day of wear pics available for you.<br /><br />But, the second pic shows my hair wet, unbrushed.<br /><br />The third pic is right after finishing! AMAZING! I was literally in awe! Couldn't believe it. Even after cosmetology school, I couldn't master a blowout on myself *cries*<br /><br />The fourth pic is the next morning. Slept on a regular cotton pillowcase (I should get a satin one from Amazon lol). I left it down while I slept btw.<br /><br />The last pic is after a go through with the flat iron. I didn't have to section my hair for once to flat iron my hair! I just ran it through with some more heat protectant as well, a must have :D<br /><br />Besides the boar bristle suggestion, I did notice the words on the dryer are already faded. It doesn't affect the dryer, so I really don't care lol. The other thing was the twisty thing to turn the dryer on, doesn't line up directly with the lights and words (OFF, AIR, LOW, HIGH). Again, I don't care but everyone different, so I wanted to let you beautiful awesome people know!<br /><br />Overall, I am so impressed and so upset at myself for not getting one of these sooner. Can't beat the value and it comes with a warranty. Thank you HAUSBELL, I LOVE YOU!❣💞🥰💇‍♀️",5

"These silicon brackets were the best product I ever purchased. It has made breathing so much easy while wearing masks. I normally wear glasses so whenever I wear a mask it always fogs with my glasses esp when it's cold outside. After putting these on I am finally able to breathe and not worry about the way the fabric touches my face when I am walking outside and no fogs in my glasses. The brackets were lightweight and comfortable to wear,great buy in these difficult times.",5
"I bought this piece specifically for the summer months and I've always been fond of blonde hair, but didn't think I would like it as much as I do. It is so cute on me, very stylish, affordable and breathable. It doesn't ever feel heavy or look awkward; I just throw it on and go. I've worn this piece to bed many times. Get up and brush out the kinks, looks good as new. For synthetic hair, this one is hard to beat. I love changing up my look so this piece will be retired in a few days, but I loved this wig so much that I wore it for two weeks in a row & I honestly can't remember the last time I did that with a synthetic piece & it STILL looks as good as it did on the first day. Go ahead and buy it.",5
"This is the best clipper I've ever had and now that my hands aren't as agile as they once were, perfect!  The handle is thicker than standard and textured w/3 indented slots; has indented area where thumb fits comfortably; is not the shiny stainless steel that is so slippery.  Now the back part/bottom is the shiny steel...I think they should have made it textured too, to ease slipperiness! The actual clipper cutting edge is the smile shape ).  The back also has a ""keyhole"" for hanging it if you wanted.  Great little file w/nicely plumped end for ease of use.  A ""nail catcher""..meaning a black tough cover that when not in use snaps on to the clipper.  All this comes in a handy little black case",4
Winter is starting to wear down but I still have super dry skin from having the heat on in the house so I got this to try to at least hydrate my skin.  It came packaged just fine without any defects.  To use you first have to unscrew the cap and pull some foil out but then it's good to go.  I put a bit on my arms and they instantly felt a ton better.  It has a nice floral smell that isn't overpowering. It goes on pretty easily and works to keep my skin hydrated.,5
"My wife had been wanting one of these for a bit so I decided to get this for her to try out.  It came packaged well with no defects.  In the box were just the ice roller and the instructions.  You put it in your freezer till it freezes (we left it in overnight). The roll is smooth and very very cold.  It is made of plastic but it doesn't feel like cheap plastic so as long as you are careful it seems like it will last.  All in all, she is happy with it so I am too.",5
I have started shaving with a safety razor and well I'm still learning it so I have had a few nicks and cuts.  I got this so I could stop the bleeding from nicks.  It comes with a decent amount that I am able to fit in a tin I keep next to my other shave gear and has stopped the bleeding from the nicks I have.  I like it more than the styptic sticks I have used in the past.,5
"I got this because I was intrigued by how they could improve on the old spray version of breath spray.  It comes in two pieces on the base which is where the battery, controls, and charging port is, and a pod for your flavor.  It has a USB c charging port which I really enjoy and seemed to charge in a decent amount of time.  I got the extra mint flavor and it tastes fine.  The thing I was not ready for is instead of spraying it comes out like a vapor.  I don't know if they would render the spray versions moot but it is nice with a good flavor.",4
I suffer from dry skin and usually soak my feet nightly. This is a great little foot bath that is collapsible and easy to store! The tools that came with I could have done without but the bath itself is great,5
"Good quality real human hair. Easy to put on. I washed my hair, “sandwich” the extensions, and then used the flat iron just for a second to melt the glue and to blend the extensions better with my natural hair. I’ve got a blonde color T18/60 + 60# in size 16 inches. The hair color doesn’t match my natural hair 100%, but it doesn’t look bad when the hair is blended. Please note that there's not much hair in the package (20pcs but the hair is thin) so you'll need more than one pack.",4
"I like this nail drill. It's basic, it's simple, easy to hold while working. It comes with a cord, 11 tips for different purposes and 50 polishing rings. There is a manual which describes different tips which is helpful for beginners. You can cut/grind/sculpt/polish your nails and even cut the cuticle. This is not the most powerful device on the market but it does the job. If you are looking for a drill to work specifically on acrylic or other artificial application nails (or nail removals) please consider getting a more powerful devise. Please note that this is not portable cordless nail drill and in order for it to work you'll have to use the cord and plug it in.",4
Fast Delivery- Stellar Customer Service.. Much appreciated..,5
This is real and pure Organic Beeswax.. I was taken aback of the high quality compared to the rest I tried.. Im sticking w this thankyou!,5
"Oh my, where to begin? No instructions. No way you can put this on the corner of the wall since it doesn't bend. The cutout notch isn't big enough, so it doesn't sit flush on a wall corner. Catnip is included but no idea where to put it since there aren't any instructions. There's holes in the back. Does catnip go there or is that for screwing it into the wall? My cats were not interested in this.",1
"New Balance is a popular brand in our home. My husband & sons wear NB shoes because they're so comfortable. The same quality applies to this headband. It has a good stretch to fit larger heads, the seams are sewn in tight & neatly, and the material is soft. Another great product from New Balance!",5
"Honest reviews matter, good or bad, so here's my thoughts...<br /><br />Pros: soft on your skin, but strong - I've rinsed & reused them; use your own product vs. pre-moistened wipes; use to clean your face, bathroom, kitchen, etc.<br />Cons: absolutely none!",5
"I was excited when I opened up the package because I didn't realize it came with two. These are cute shower caps with a great texture that isn't like others I've used, though I can't describe it. Unfortunately, this didn't fit over my hair (too much hair!) so I wouldn't buy this again unless it came in other sizes. Still, I used it in the shower and it did a great job of keeping the hair that it did cover, dry. Also, it seems like it, somehow, isn't a soaking mess once you come out of the shower. Good shower cap if you have thinner hair or hair that's styled in a flat way.",3
Not very lightweight. This stuff was thick and not easy to use. because it was so thick it was not natural looking at all. I am not satisfied with this and wont be using.,2
"Cute colors my toddlers gets to pick the colors she wants when we get our hair done. It's has a good stretch, great for my baby's afro hair. Excellent price point",5
"Great moisturizer. It goes on light and doesn’t make my skin feel sticky, It absorbs quickly leaving my skin hydrated, it's also good for the summer",5
"Exactly product I must say, I have dry skin and always In search of a light weight hydrating face moisturizer. And am glad I tried this, it's not sticky and very hydrating. Down side for me is, it's very pricey. But I definitely recommend It, would be nice to have some discount on.",5
"I can't tell you how much this have been helping my little ones eczema that itches all day behind the legs..... once I rub it on the spot the skin is immediately hydrated, stop itching. The scaring and rough skin is also clearing. Am really happy using this product. And I will definitely buy more. I also it on my edges too and I have noticed growth.",5
So I thought this will be nice for my 4c hair but  no. So I used it on my wigs and I didn't really like the results. Its definitely not for my hair type.,3
"I tested this out on my pugs the day it arrived.  I first tested to make sure they didn't fight me too much when I stuck their feet inside of the cup.  They didn't.  So, I filled with warm water, stuck their foot inside, turned the cup, then pulled their feet out to dry.<br />Seemed to work good.  I just want to be able to rinse their feet of any dirt, sand, pebbles, or anything else that gets stuck in their pads.<br />I like that it has a small handle so I can hook it up near the back door.",5
"Not sure about the calming or soothing effects this is suppose to give my skin.  But, my skin is feeling a lot softer after using this for 4 days now.<br />Easy to open and use.  Just place rubber piece, that's included, over the top of a glass ample.  Holding onto the rubber piece, bend and snap the glass top off.  Turn the rubber top upside down to discard the piece of glass top.<br />Then pour liquid onto your palm and apply to face and neck.  Absorbs within a few mins.",4
"I want to use this spray on the bedding.  All the bedding.  Makes it smell so nice for when we all go to bed.  Just a nice fresh scent.<br />I can't really pick out a particular scent with this spray.  It's a nice combination though.<br />With spring here and the windows open again, we're all loving having a nice fresh scent in our bedrooms and our beds using this spray.",5
"I really love having so many stencils to choose from.  When I found a couple I really liked, I numbered them so I'll remember which ones I like.<br />The powder is messy.  Have to be so careful not to get any on myself because it will stain.<br />The color is nice for my brown/gray hair.<br />It takes a bit of trial and error when first using this kit.  Not to dab too hard to have the powder go on way too dark.  Finding the right stencil that fits my face.<br />I did a lot of scrubbing until I finally got the combination down.  So far the color has lasted about 3 days.  I'll use a brush to fine tune them a little.<br />Love having actual eyebrows again.",4
"Looking at the design of the case this is in, it looks like the smaller part of the top should open.  If it is suppose to open, I can't figure it out.  So, I just unscrewed the entire top off to use it.  Not really a big issue.<br />The foundation itself is waterproof.  Does last all day with no problem.<br />It's a nice smooth foundation.  Easy to apply with the sponge that comes with this.<br />It does cover up some of the skin flaws.<br />It's an okay foundation for a decent price.  Kept my skin soft all day.<br />Was easy enough to wash off at the end of the day.  I would buy again.",4
I like the size of this.  It's nice and small so it's easy to keep in my purse for when I need it.<br />Easy to use.  Just roll on my face and it absorbs any oils without messing up my makeup.<br />Does come with a second ball.<br />Not sure how long the one ball will last since I just started using it.  Seems that it would last quite a long time.,5
I don't like the pump of this wash.  It's so small that it takes so many pumps to get a small amount.  I finally gave up and just poured it out of the bottle.<br />Scent....Not the greatest.  It doesn't last long which is nice because it's not a scent I want to smell like when I get out of the shower.<br />Did lather nice.  Rinsed off and I felt clean.<br />Maybe men would like this better than women.  And some  may like how it smells.  Just not a scent for me.,4
"After using different tattoo machines, this one is more just for beginners.<br />It's light and easy to use.  Kit comes with almost everything needed to start practicing.<br />I wanted to see how good this machine would do with lines.  It's okay but, the machine does get a bit on the warm side after having it run for about 60-90 mins.<br />All in all this kit is nice.",4
"I'll say it, I hate shaving.  The older I get the more hair I get on my upper lip.  Horrible.<br />So I am now trying this laser tool to see if it'll help with at least most of my unwanted hair.<br />I haven't been using it long.  I clean and then I shave the areas that I want to laser treat.<br />I would say that after about 3 weeks/3 times a week, you'll see at least a little difference if not a big difference.<br />The device is easy to hold in one hand.<br />Says that it will last my lifetime.  And it probably will.  The  most I'll be using it is the first month or two.  After that I expect only maintenance use.<br />No counter to count down the number of used flashes.  But it's okay.  Not a big deal.<br />It does have to be plugged in.  Again, not an issue.  I only have it out, while using it, for about 10 mins tops.  Takes me 2 seconds to plug it in.<br />Love having this.  Anything that makes a day go a bit easier is okay with me.",4
It's so hard to find good tweezers that actually grab the hair.  These tweezers seem to work nicely.<br />I tried 3 of them so far and I have no complaints.<br />The case is nice to keep them all organized and easy to find.  The eyebrow brush was a nice addition to this set.<br />The curved scissors work great also.<br />Glad to have this set in my collection.  Will make it so much easier when I need to do a bit of face grooming.,5
"Fantastic facial cleaning brush.  I like that it has a pretty case to use if I ever travel with it.  You can store the other brushes (comes with 3.  One for massage, one for sensitive skin and one normal brush)<br />Great that the battery holds a charge for about 30 uses.  Nice feature for when I'm on the road and don't want to bother with the charger at every hotel.<br />Has 3 speeds so you can decide on how much brushing you want on your face.<br />My face feels so clean after I'm done using it.  I put on some night cream, with the massage brush, afterwards and my face is so smooth.  I love it.<br />I'm also wondering how difficult it will be to find replacement brush heads.",5
"It does make my hair soft but, I can't take the minty smell it has!  I use Pantene products all the time and was shocked when I was in the shower and put this conditioner on my head.  I stopped and looked at the bottle to see what exactly I was using. Doesn't smell nice like the other Pantene Conditioners I've used.  Going to have to put this bottle under my cabinet to use only when I'm desperate. Will go back to the other Pantene conditioners. And I will always open and smell any new shampoo or conditioner I buy.",2
"I got this product hoping it would help with my super coarse facial hair (I’m a woman). It doesn’t, but that isn’t the product’s fault. I read online that really coarse hair has to be pretty long (like half an inch long!) for waxing to be effective, and who would want to let their facial hair grow like that? Not me!<br /><br />It works for other types of hair, though. I was able to wax my legs. The temperature control is reassuring (no worries about burns), and the roll on applicator is way less messy than sticks in a pot. It comes with plenty of supplies, too. So, even though I didn’t get my wish, I think this kit is a good one.",4
"These patches work as well as other patches I've tried. They are not a miraculous cure-all, but they do help flatten out the acne and draw out the stuff that needs to be drawn out (don't want to get too gross and graphic here). They are small (1 cm diameter) so the coverage is limited, but they adhere well.<br /><br />There are a couple of cons with these that lower my score:<br /><br />> They are harder to peel off the backing than others, and it's easy to fold over the edge of the patch when removing it, making it less effective. Other brands I've used have slits in the backing material, making it much easier to dispense a patch without damaging it.<br /><br />> The packaging is very wasteful. Each sheet of 20 comes in its own box. You could easily fit several sheets into one box. Either the box should be made much smaller or each box should hold multiple sheets. There's no need for all this packaging waste.<br /><br />Three stars (average). While these work as well as other patches, there are other options that are better choices.",3
"This is a pretty good cream for dealing with ultra dry, cracked skin. I've used it with good results on my elbows -- it softens, soothes and helps with healing. There's only a small hint of a scent to it that is only noticeable if you smell the cream in the jar. Once it's applied there's no scent that I can detect, which is a major plus.<br /><br />It's a soft cream that's easy to dispense and spread. That's also a plus since other intensive moisturizing creams I've tried tend to be more solid and harder to use. This has more of a whipped cream type of consistency that's easy to work with.<br /><br />It does take time to soak in, and my skin remains greasy feeling for a while after using it. It's not a significant problem for elbows, knees, feet, etc., but is a issue when using it on my hands. The greasy feeling makes it not a great hand cream other than at night.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a better than average intensive moisturizing cream. A solid 4 stars.",4
"This are mini wipes, with each measuring about 5.25 by 4.25 inches. They are packaged very compactly, making them easy to take along in a gym bag, backpack or even in your pocket. The packet is soft, which means it's not ideal for dispensing one wipe at a time without some measure of struggle. There's an adhesive flap to cover the opening, but again, as with pretty much any packet with this design, the flap doesn't do nearly as good of a job as a hard plastic cover.<br /><br />The wipe material is soft but pretty durable. It's designed to be a ""prep"" before using a stick-on breathing strip on your nose. As such, it doesn't do all that good of a job. While it does contain witch hazel, there's too little of it for the wipe to perform well. Witch hazel is the last ingredient (after water, glycerin, and aloe). Witch hazel is a great prep for any adhesive to ensure a good skin bond. Using these wipes is really no better for that task than plain water.<br /><br />While it is a comfortable wipe to use for general face and hand cleaning, given the price and the lack of unique benefits re: better adhesion, I see this as a 3 star (average) product at best. It's not something I'd get again.",3
"I'm very pleased with this face cleaner. It is a medium thick consistency that has a creamy texture. It lathers a bit slowly at first, but builds up a nice, thick lather after a few moments. Not much is needed per use -- just a dab will get the job done. It cleans very well but doesn't leave my face dry. I've had zero irritation from it even though it's a good, deep cleaner.<br /><br />The scent is very enjoyable. It's a light floral/fruity scent that is unique. It is not overpowering, and doesn't linger after rinsing.<br /><br />The tube comes nicely packaged for protection during transit. It's in a reinforced box cardboard box that is shrink wrapped. Even if it's sent in a padded envelope there's very little risk of the tube leaking in transit.<br /><br />No complaints at all. It works very well, has an enjoyable, unique scent, is packaged well, and since so little is needed per use, the value is pretty good. Five stars!",5
"I'm very pleased with all aspects of this face wash. It's a medium consistency that dispenses easily. The pump mechanism works well to output just a small amount at a time which is a plus since not much is needed per use. It lathers readily and does an excellent job of cleaning. My face feels tight after using it but in a good way -- a clean tightness rather than a dried out tightness.<br /><br />The scent is excellent. It's a woodsy type of scent that is different and very enjoyable. The scent does not linger after use (which is a shame since it is such a nice smell).<br /><br />It's pricey per ounce, but considering how little is needed for good results, the cost per use is not bad at all. Plus the scent is so unique that, for me, it's worth the extra amount. Five stars!",5
"I'm pleased with this face scrub. It hits the right middle ground: not so coarse that you feel as if you're rubbing gravel on your face, but not so fine that there's no scrub action. This provides a good amount of scrubbing but not to the point where it's irritating. It's a medium thick cream consistency that spreads easily. Not much is needed per use.<br /><br />The scent is fairly mild and while you can pick out the eucalyptus scent it's not so strong to be overwhelming, as eucalyptus can sometimes get. The scent does not linger after rinsing.<br /><br />Checks all the right boxes for me for a face scrub. Five stars.",5
"I've not come across a face soap in this format -- it's a stick format, much like an antiperspirant. You rub the stick on your dry face, then use water. It's different but very easy to get used to quickly.<br /><br />The soap doesn't lather all that much but it does do a good job of cleaning without drying out my face. The scent is quite nice, with the eucalyptus coming through the most. It's a medium/mild level of scent that is noticeable without being overwhelming. The scent does not linger after rinsing. The soap itself is black due to the inclusion of charcoal.<br /><br />The dispensing tube is well done, with a screw base that pushes up the soap easily and evenly. It also has a screw top cover, which is a nice touch for keeping the lid affixed if you take this while traveling or use it in a gym bag.<br /><br />It's an unusual but enjoyable twist on face soap. A bit pricey for the amount you get, but it's sufficiently unique to justify the cost, in my opinion. Five stars.",5
"This is a comprehensive set of nail cutting/trimming/maintaining tools. The standard clipper is very nice -- solid, sharp, and well up to the task of handling fingernails and lighter toenails. The various tools are also of decent quality.<br /><br />What's not so good is the toenail clippers. It has a rather lightweight feel to it compared with other clippers I've used. The short handles make it less comfortable to use than other clippers. More importantly, the spring mechanism failed within the first couple of minutes of use. It uses two leaf style springs that push the jaws apart. The problem is with how they attach to the handle. There are two little prongs for each spring that fit into two little holes in the handle. For mine, the pins are too short to make a solid connection, so one falls (or rather, jumps) out no matter how many times I've tried to seat it properly into the handle (see photo).  It can be used without the spring, but it's quite cumbersome to do so. Given the importance of the toenail clipper to the overall usefulness of the kit, I see this as a 2 star product.<br /><br />If the springs were better it would be 4 stars since, even when properly functioning, the clippers are not as easy to use as others, but warrant 4 stars given the low cost compared with better quality clippers.",2
"I’m not all that impressed with these products. Neither container lists the ingredients on the label, instead providing the ingredient list on a card that’s in the box. It shows that the cleaner is a 2% salicylic acid wash, which is a pretty tried and true formulation for treating acne. It is a low-lather, but still effective cleaner, but I didn’t experience any difference with this compared with other 2% salicylic cleaners that cost far less. It’s a fine cleaner, but way overpriced for such a tiny (0.51 oz) container.<br /><br />The repairing night cream is a combination of retinol (0.05%), niacinamide (3%), and hyaluronic acid (2%). All are proven performers, but again, it’s quite overpriced considering how low of a percentage of retinol is in the formulation. It does a decent job of moisturizing and did not cause any skin irritation. I am a fan of retinol, but the concentration in this cream (0.05%) is well below what I usually use (either 0.1% or 0.5%).<br /><br />While this product combo is on the right track, the value is just not there considering the amount in the container (one-half an ounce for each). While I would certainly recommend a salicylic acid wash and a retinol-based cream, there are many other options that provide these options at a far lower cost. Four stars for performance; 1 star for value; overall rating of 2.5 stars.",2
"I love the look of these bottles. They are cobalt blue, and really stand out from the usual amber tints. The bottle itself is well-made and sturdy. The included caps (2 were provided) are of excellent quality, with polycone inserts to maintain an air-tight, leak proof seal. The included sprayers (2 were provided) are functional, but rather cheap in terms of build quality, especially the trigger. It also comes with a tiny little funnel that is way undersized and pretty useless given the bottle volume, and a few black labels (which require a white pen, which is NOT included).<br /><br />Each bottle comes in a bubble pack sleeve, but the box itself is rather thin with limited protection. These are a notch below other bottles I've received when it comes to manufacturer-provided protective packing. Still, the bottles did not break or chip in transit.<br /><br />The bottles needed a good wash before use since the outside had some type of greasy-feeling film. I would have washed them regardless of their condition, but these definitely needed a good washing before use.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration I'll rate these as 4 stars. Well worth considering if you need a more colorful option than amber and don't expect to be using the sprayer much (or at all).",4
"There are a number of positive features of this face wash. I love the scent -- it's a light, ""fresh"" scent that is sort of floral and sort of botanical. Normally I prefer unscented (or something that just smells soapy) but this light scent is quite enjoyable. It's a thick cream that resembles a moisturizer more so than a soap.<br /><br />There's virtually no lather to it. It foams up a bit, but very lightly. It's a very gentle soap but, for me, it's a bit too gentle in that I don't have a clean feeling after using it. My face feels more like I've applied a moisturizer. That's not a bad thing, especially in the dry winter months, but I want to have a clean-feeling face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the positive and negative features puts my rating at three stars (average). It smell great and it is very gentle, but it's not a face soap I'd get again. There are other gentle soaps that also offer better cleaning and a better value on a cost per ounce basis.",3
"I'm impressed with how well these glass bottles are packaged by the manufacturer. Each bottle is double-packed in bubble pack, and all accessories are wrapped up so they can't move around and damage the glass bottles. Even though the shipping box was beat up, the bottles were all 100% fine.<br /><br />The glass is of good quality in terms of thickness, and quite sturdy (as far as glass can be, however). The brown tinting is excellent for UV protection of the contents. The accessories are mostly useful items, with the best ones being the caps and the funnel. The caps have an insert to provide an excellent seal, which is key to maintaining content freshness. They also come with spray heads that, while functional, are rather lightweight in terms of build quality.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent set of bottles that are packaged very well, and come with some very useful extras. Very pleased!",5
"I'm very pleased with these glass bottles. The glass is thick and, while it's certainly not immune to breaking, it can deal with the occasional bump without a problem. Having it be tinted brown is great for limiting the amount of UV that can enter, plus gives it a nice look.  The caps are excellent and provide a good seal. The sprayers are just OK. They work, but are not all that heavy-duty. I'm using these more for storage than application, so I'm more interested in the cap seal than the sprayer.<br /><br />It also comes with a very useful funnel, a dropper and a white marker. The funnel is something that I'll use often; I won't use the others. But, it's a nice complement of accessories.<br /><br />The bottles come very well packaged with two layers of bubble pack, and are in a box that's the right size to prevent things from moving around. They arrived in perfect shape even though they were shipped in a non-padded ship bag.<br /><br />Very pleased with the set -- 5 stars!",5
"I'm impressed with this face soap. It's very thick and silky, and only a very small amount is needed to get good results. That's especially welcome to find out given the price for a pretty small bottle.  It lathers up well and does a good job of cleaning without leaving my skin overly dry. It is a bit more intensive than other face soaps, so my face does feel a little 'tight' after using it. However, it's not excessive, and well worth it given how well this soap cleans if you have an oily complexation. The charcoal makes the soap dark, but it's not as jet-black as other charcoal soaps I've used. It's more of a deep gray.<br /><br />The scent is also quite nice. It's a medium/light intensity and has sort of an after-shave smell to it. The scent does not linger much at all after rinsing. While I tend to prefer unscented soaps, this scent is pleasant and enjoyable.<br /><br />The only con is the bottle. Getting the pump nozzle to pop up was a chore since the retaining ring the pump head screws into also rotates, making it a struggle to get the nozzle to pop up. I eventually got it working, but have noticed that the pump leaks at the stem. It's a small leak, but it adds up over a few days to make a mess on the bottle and waste soap.  Given the price, the pump mechanism should have been of better quality.<br /><br />One star down for the bottle issues, but otherwise, it's a very enjoyable soap to use.",4
"I like the small, compact size of these spray bottles. The height makes them easy to stow in a cabinet without taking up much room at all. Of course, a small size means small capacity, but for my needs that's a perfectly fine trade-off.<br /><br />What's not so good is the overall build quality. The bottles are made of thin plastic that look and feel cheap. The trigger action on the sprayers is not smooth or reliable. The sprayer hose detaches easily.<br /><br />Given the price, these are 2 stars for value -- they look, feel and perform as a bottle you'd get in a dollar store. A shame, since it can be hard to find compact spray bottles.",2
"These are reasonably durable mask holder bands. The ""fingers"" that hold the mask straps are thin, but I didn't experience any tearing even when tugging on them a lot harder than they would be exposed to in normal use. The fingers are widely spaced and can deal with flat-style elastic bands without a problem.<br /><br />My only quibble is that they are a bit too short in length. While using them does increase mask comfort around my ears, they would be better if they were about an inch or so longer.<br /><br />Not ideal, but a helpful aid to increase long-term mask wearing comfort especially with masks that have short ear loops.",4
"This is a pretty basic toothbrush. It lacks the features found on more expensive toothbrushes, such as sculpted bristle patterns, but it performs just fine. The bristles are a medium/soft density which works well for me -- firm enough for good cleaning but soft enough that it doesn't cause any gum irritation. The handles are also pretty basic but the bamboo makes them more grippy than the basic plastic brushes.<br /><br />The bristles are all firmly attached. None have come loose after a good amount of use. I can't say the charcoal infused bristles do anything beyond what a regular bristle does, but they look nice.<br /><br />Each comes individually packed and includes a tiny tube of toothpaste. It's a great item to have on hand for situations such as house guests who forget to bring a brush, for traveling, to stow in your desk at work, etc.<br /><br />No complaints. They work well, and I'm glad that it's a way to use/discard less plastic waste.",5
"This is a good middle ground between the standard Oral-B brand brushes and the Ultra Soft Oral-B brand brushes. I find the standard brush to be a bit too firm and, while I like the softness of the Ultra Soft, sometimes I'd like just a bit more firmness to the bristles. This is a good compromise. It's softer than the standard but firmer than the Ultra Soft.<br /><br />On the downside, it does not fit as well as the authentic Oral-B brushes. It's a little bit loose, which causes it to be noisier in operation than an authentic brush. It still works fine and stays on firm enough so there's no danger of it coming off in use, but there's enough play in the fit that it's more buzzy than an authentic.<br /><br />Even with the fit issue, this is a decent alternative to the Oral-B brand brushes and a solid 4-star brush.",4
"This is a “dressed up” version of the Wahl “LifeProof” shaver (which I also reviewed). It has a more upscale look and feel to it, plus adds a battery gauge to show the charge level. However, the shave quality is the same – OK, but not a standout.<br /><br />The case feels more solid than the LifeProof and, while it’s more of a traditional look, I think they did a nice job with the overall aesthetics. It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br /><br />The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br /><br />The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br /><br />Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and ‘shash trimming.<br /><br />The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br /><br />I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars). It’s a very workable shaver, but for the price there are better choices available from Panasonic (anything in their Arc line) or, for less money, from Remington.",3
"I hate winter for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that my hands get so dry that I get cracks at my fingertips. It’s annoying and painful, especially at night. I’ve tried all sorts of moisturizers without much success. The best results (if you can call it that) have been from using petroleum jelly, but that’s messy and it still doesn’t work well.<br /><br />This argan oil, however, has been hugely effective. It gave me results right from the first day, and over the course of just a few days I can see noticeable healing of the skin cracks. No more pain and my hands feel far better than any other treatment I’ve tried.<br /><br />The product comes very nicely packaged, with a nice box filled with shredded packing material to keep the glass bottle safe in transit. It also makes for a very nice presentation should you want to give this as a gift. The bottle comes with a dropper and a “spritz” head. The latter is my only quibble – the spray head didn’t work well at all, and made sort of a mess when using it to dispense the oil. I replaced it with the dropper and had much better results.<br /><br />The oil itself has little or no scent. You need very, very little for results – I use about 1-2 small drops per hand, and that’s more than enough. It spreads easily (as expected given that it’s oil). It does take a few minutes to soak in – my hands are very greasy when I first apply it, but after a few minutes the greasiness goes away. The sheen from the oil stays around longer, but that too dissipates after 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />This can be used for a wide range of applications including face, body and even hair. It comes with a good amount of information to help explain how/where to use it, and how the oil was processed.<br /><br />I’m very impressed with this oil – it’s the only product I’ve ever tried that totally worked to solve my dry/cracked hands. It’s not cheap, but well worth the price if you need a highly effective moisturizer. Highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",5
"This is a nice improvement to the Sonicare line of brushes. It appears to be their response to the Oral-B Floss Action line of brushes that have a ""paddle"" to help get between teeth. This accomplishes that goal with an plastic insert in the middle that helps direct the toothpaste between your teeth.<br /><br />I use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000. Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort. The Sonicare Hydroclean's bristles are stiffer and I find that they irritate my gums when used several times in a row.<br /><br />But, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth. I'm a tea drinker and getting the stains out between my front teeth has always been a chore. The Hydroclean works very well - noticeable improvement over the Sonicare ProResults and the Oral-B.<br /><br />These only come in the standard size. The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots. But, I assume that a smaller version of this would not function well since the plastic insert would have to be very small.<br /><br />If you're a ProResults user these are well worth trying out. If you have tender gums you may want to alternate between the HydroClean and the ProResults (or, as I do, with the Oral-B. The Oral-B also makes a super soft brush if you have very sensitive gums. Hard to find, but works very well).<br /><br />Keep in mind that nothing takes the place of flossing. No matter what you use, you still need to break out the floss to keep your teeth healthy!",5
"I have always been curious about trying some of these eye mask patches and I received two different kinds around the same time. I definitely preferred these over the other ones I received. I know it doesn’t really matter, but these are so pretty. They have a shimmery gold color to them that just makes wearing them more fun. I don’t suffer from eye wrinkles yet, but I do occasionally get bags under my eyes. I’m honestly not sure if I can say these get rid of the bags, but after wearing them for a little while, they definitely make my eyes feel better, which is still a win in my opinion. You get a ton of them in the container, which is great, but I feel like the container could be a little bit higher quality. It’s not smooth when you close the lid–not a huge problem, but a better quality container would have made this feel even more luxurious.",4
"These are good, but not my favorite masks. My biggest complaint about these, which others might actually find a benefit, is that I think there is way too much product on these masks. Obviously, these kinds of masks tend to be a little messy because of the product that they are soaked in, but with these, they are just dripping. After removing the mask, the instructions say to rub in any excess product into your skin, but there's just way too much and it does not rub in. I have to blot my skin with a towel before rubbing in the excess. Other than that, the mask is nice. It feels soothing to the skin, I haven't had any reactions to it and my skin feels soft afterward.",4
These eyeshadow pens glide on very smoothly. One is a solid color and the other two have shimmer. The 03 color pen is really light. It is shimmery and you primarily only see the shimmer which is okay.,4
"This lip balms smells awesome. It also did a nice job of moisturizing my lips while it was on. I do feel like after it was gone, my lips seemed a little dryer. The color had a very slight tint of pink and it had my lips glossed but not overly glossed.",4
This product completely turned me off by the scent. Is decided to still try it in my hair but I did not find that it was very moisturizing either.,2
These lashes are okay looking. They are not as full as I prefer. They did stick but I didn't feel they were as secure as I'd like for them to be if I'm going out the house.,4
"This is a no for me. This wig came very curly and not of an afro type. Even after combing and brushing, it was still not an afro. In other people's pictures I see that they have a real afro. Maybe I was sent to wrong wig but it is just curls and the hairs does not look long like the other wigs people have shown.",1
"This wig is full of beautiful curls!! I love this tighter curl pattern.  Once it's washed and the curls get a little more full and less uniform, it will be even more beautiful. It's so soft! I like the fit on my head. There is a comb in the back and one on each side.",5
"At this price, this set is a good value in terms of quantity, variety of styles and sturdiness. I've only had them for a few days so I can't say for sure that they're going to be durable, but I did slam them repeatedly on my tile floors with far more force than with the impact of simply falling, and they're still in tact.<br /><br />I have thin hair and the clips grasp nicely and wear comfortably. They open wide enough that I'm sure they'll work for thick hair, too.<br /><br />The colors were a little off, at least on my monitor. The one that looks gold on my screen is actually a light tan. I will probably never wear it out of the house. It looks awful with my red hair and I can't think of many outfits it would match either. That's why the set loses a star for me. The brownish one is lighter than pictured, too.",4
This Soybean skin conditioning serum is a nice light unscented moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft. No heavy fragrance or dyes. Everything is in Japanese so you will need to use a translation tool to read the box. The box comes sealed so I was happy about that.,4
This jade roller bottle has been great for applying massage oil when I use a gua sha tool on the neck and back of my spouse. It gives the right amount of oil and spreads it around nicely. The jade ball feels very comfortable when rolling it on the skin.<br /><br />Note: the bottle is not sealed so any liquids inside the bottle will flow out if not kept upright.,4
Good quality comb. I would not say it's a pocket comb since it's quite large. I would say this would be an excellent comb to have in a travel toiletry bag.,4
"I love castor oil and use a lot of it, but rarely for my hair. I've never seen or used castor oil ""butter"" before and I think it's very interesting. All the oils in this product are normally liquid at room temperature so I'm not sure how they got this to have a butter-like consistency. Maybe some beeswax or something was added but it's not on the list of ingredients. I really like the tea tree oil scent this castor oil butter has as tea tree is one of my favorite scents.  I think this is a very good castor oil product.",5
Very good fake beard and moustache and fun for cosplay.  It looks pretty real when on.,4
"I've used a lot different concealers over the years but I must say that I think the Marine Forest is my least favorite.  The sticks are fat and not good for precision application, and it seems that the concealer doesn't really do a good job of concealing.  I had to go over this concealer with another concealer to cover the dark circles underneath my eyes.",2
"This nose hair trimmer turned on one time after charging, and has since failed to turn on.  Hubs and I both tried to get it to work, put it back on the charger to be sure,  but it's obviously malfunctioning or poorly made.  We have tossed it in the trash.",1
I have bleached blonde hair with a lot of silver mixed in.  I color it at home and if I don't use products to control brassiness my hair will start to turn kind of orangish.  I really like this shampoo.  It's nice and dark purple and lathers up really nice.  It cleans my hair well and thoroughly rinses out.  The creme rinse doesn't do much as far as conditioning or de-tangling but should help to keep hair from color warping.  It's not as dark purple as the shampoo and has no scent that I can detect.,4
"This is a nice set of 4, 2.53 fl. oz. tubes of moisturizing lotion.  My hands and face feel nicely hydrated and there's no annoying scent to deal with.  These are the perfect size for a purse, backpack or pocket and they seem reasonably priced.  As of this review a set of 4 only costs $14.25.",5
"I use almond oil in my handmade soaps to make them extra emollient.  It's also a wonderful moisturizer for skin and dry/damaged hair.  I think this is very good sweet almond oil, it's 100% almond oil and there's nothing negative I can find to say about it.",5
"These are pretty, pastel colored cloth covered headbands.  I like the scrunchie look they have.  They hold my hair out of my face very well and don't bother me much around the backs of my ears.  Sometimes head bands start to hurt my head but so far these haven't.  They're not super good quality - about a dollar each, but they do what I want them to do.",4
"If you mix up approximately 2 tablespoons (close enough to 1 and 2/3rds) you can sort of taste the berry flavor but it's basically bland and flavorless.  That's fine, you can add a flavoring to it if you want too.  As far as helping me get to sleep it doesn't.  1mg of melatonin does nothing for me.  I like that one serving delivers 10 mg of collagen but it's only one type - bovine collagen.  I think it's kind of pricey coming in at $34.95 (as of this review) since I've reviewed collagen powders that contains several types of collagen and were more than 9.3 oz for as much or even less money.  Also, you won't see any results in 2 weeks so don't let those reviews get you all excited.  I've been consuming collagen on a daily basis for about a year and am now just beginning to see some positive changes in my skin and nails.  I'm 63 and realize all the collagen supplements in the world won't make me look 40 again but I have seen some improvements in less crinkly skin on my arms and some fine lines around my eyes looking much smoother.  Collagen is not the fountain of youth but it does help if you are patient and consistent.",4
"I have used a lot of castor oil over the years but mainly in my hand made soaps. I like it to be very viscous, sticky and have that castor oil scent. This oil fulfills all my qualifications for a good quality castor oil. It has many uses besides being a great emollient in soaps, so I will be using it for my skin and hair as well. It's one of the best that I've reviewed so far. Please note that this castor oil is for EXTERNAL use only and not to be taken internally. If you want castor oil for that search for food grade castor oil.",5
This is the perfect sized boar bristle hair brush to put in my purse or tennis bag.  It's not too small but it's not full-sized either.  I love these types of brushes the best (especially those with bamboo bristles) because they brush all of my hair and not just the top of it.  It feels good on my scalp too.  The wood grain in the brown handle is lovely too making it a pretty brush as well as very functional.,5
"The shampoo comes out of the bottle really DARK blue but lathers up nice and white.  It cleans my hair nicely, rinses out easily and has no strong or perfumed scent at all.  I have been lightening my hair using home kits and prefer shampoos and creme rinses that help control any brassiness.  The conditioner is a much lighter color and makes my hair feel great.  It's easy to comb out and blow dry.  However, it will leave your shower floor very slick so be careful with this stuff.",5
"This is a little jar of face cream for $27.98 (the price as of this review).  It feels good on my facial skin, but honestly, it doesn't moisturize it any better than many less expensive creams I've used and reviewed.  It's good, but I just don't see why it costs so much money.  The texture is close to that of sour cream and it's easy to apply.  It's a little greasy for a short while until it gets absorbed.",4
I like this castor oil shampoo though I don't know how much castor oil it contains.  Castor oil is wonderful for hair and skin and I use a lot of it in my hand made soaps because it makes them very emollient and soothing to the skin.  This is a huge bottle of shampoo and will last me a long time.  It makes very good lather - nice and light and it rinses out well.  My hair is very clean afterwards.  I still use a good conditioner afterwards because my hair is a little damaged from being lightened.  This shampoo has a very light scent too.  There's nothing negative I can find to say about it.,5
"I'm particular about headbands and have reviewed some that just didn't work out too well for various reasons. However, these headbands (2 in a pack) are holding my hair out of my face just fine, and they don't get my head sore after wearing one for several hours.  They are made out of breakable plastic so I have to be a little careful with them, but they are very pretty in their unusual colorful design.  They have tiny little teeth in some spots to  grab hair and that makes the headbands very stable.  I think these are really good and am glad I finally decided to select them for review.",5
"I have several of this type of eyebrow pencil but in a different shade.  These are the kind that allow you to try make lines that look like hairs though I have never been really all that good at doing that.  This is the first gray color eye brow pencil I've used and I like it pretty well.  The gray color is medium - not dark or light, but right there in the middle.  I use a very light touch and short strokes to get the color where I want it.  I have scant eye brow hairs and have to fill in to make it look like I have full eyebrows.  I like how this did, it seems to be waterproof and I really need waterproof because I play a lot of tennis and sweat a lot on the court under the hot sun in the Deep South.  I sweated a lot at practice last night and when I woke up this morning my eyebrows were still mostly there.  I can't complain about that.",5
"I checked the ingredients list of this non-aluminum containing deodorant and everything that's in it is what I put in my own home made deodorants.  Shea buttter, coconut oil, arrowroot powder, cornstarch, essential oils, etc...  It has a lovely scent, and you don't need much.  It won't stop sweating, but it will keep the smelly bacteria from breeding for a while so you don't stink.  I could feel the slight graininess of the cornstarch and arrowroot powder which let me know it was good quality.  I really like this and feel it is every bit as good as my own homemade deodorant.",5
"These headbands are made out of strong metal and are well painted.  I like them but find that the tips are a little irritating - need more rubber on the them.  The wavy part sort of grabs my hair in a comb-backed way, but not all of it so I have to decide it I want my front hair loose or try to get the waves to comb more of it back.  These are very well made and should last a long time.  I haven't tried wearing more than one at a time but that might be a good idea.",4
"I love bamboo brushes with bamboo bristles.  They feel so good on my scalp - like a scalp massage when I brush my hair with them.  This brush is really good, though I would have liked for the bristles pegs to be a little longer.  I find I have to push the brush down harder to get to my scalp.  I have another bamboo brush with longer bristles that I like best but this one is still a very good brush especially if you have short hair.  The comb that comes with it is good for getting tangles out of thick hair and one of my kids has laid claim to it.",4
"I can't tell if my teeth are any whiter or not after using but I can tell that my sink and counter top are a lot darker.  It's messy.  But I still like it a lot.  The powder is very fine and not coarse, and has no flavor.  It think the activated charcoal is very good quality.  I use activated charcoal a lot but not so much for brushing my teeth.  I make handmade soaps and I like to make BLACK soaps because they are so cool looking and clean the skin so well.  I used some of this in some soap and it worked great!  The toothbrush is good and so is the tongue scraper though I prefer a larger tongue scraper.",5
These are just what I need to keep some loose hairs around my face from flying around and getting into my eyes.  I played a tennis match yesterday and the wind was just ferocious.  If I didn't have these little barrettes in my hair I would have gone nuts.  These are perfect for when you need a lot of them at one time like I did yesterday.  I think I had at least 8 of them in my hair at one time but they looked fine and I like the choice of colors and they worked perfectly.,5
"I pretty much have chronically dry, chapped lips, especially in the winter.  I'm frequently grabbing my lip glosses, balms, and anything greasy that I can put on them.  I find that this Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm is very soothing to my poor lips and really makes them feel so nicely moisturized.  It goes on easily and is clear if I want to use some on the back of my dry hands when I can't find any lotion.  I can't really taste any tangerine flavor, but the scent is definitely there and is very pleasant.",5
"I've reviewed other lotions that were pricey like this one, as of this review this Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion costs $25.90.  I think that's kind of expensive because though it's a good moisturizer, it's not a great moisturizer.  I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels good, but my skin is not as moisturized as some other lotions and creams that I've used.  I like the shape of the bottle because I can keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed.  But, I wouldn't be real thrilled if I paid nearly $26.00 for a 6.8 fl. oz bottle of this lotion and only got an average level of moisturization.",3
"These face lift tapes aren't bad as long as you don't get your hopes up that you will look 20 years younger.  I'm nearly 62 and my facial skin is sagging - the reason for me selecting these face lift tapes when they appeared on my list of items I could review.  Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers.  They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some.  However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show.  The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out but you get 40 in a box.  Again, these do work, and help eliminate some drooping skin, but they aren't a really good solution, imho.",3
"These tongue scrapers do an excellent job of getting all the yucky stuff off your tongue which is LOADED with bacteria and is the main source of halitosis.  I always brush my tongue with a stiff bristled tooth brush, then my teeth with my Sonicare and to finish off the routine I use my tongue scraper to get the last bit of slime off my tongue.  I've used a plastic tongue scraper for years and it does real well and so do these metal ones.",5
"I was really happy to receive this 4 oz. bottle of ""Organic Moroccan Argon Oil"" but it does not appear to be very organic nor pure argan oil.  It's loaded with other chemicals, and perfume.  Upon opening the bottle I wondered why it had a scent, was clear and somewhat thin.  I have several other brand of PURE Argan oil and it is thick, yellowish and has a musty/dirt-like scent.  I can't give this Livordo Argan oil a high star rating since what it advertises doesn't seem to be what you get.",2
"These are o.k. nail files, but I wouldn't use the gray side at all as it too rough.  I would use the buff side to actually file my nails - if I wanted to use them.  I find the thickness of the nail file a little hard to hold and will continue to use my wonderful slim glass nail file and super fine sandpaper to smooth the edges.  I play and teach classical guitar and I need my nails to be just right to get good contact with the strings and these nail files leave my nails too rough on the edges.  They are well packaged and colorful and would make a nice gift for someone who isn't as fussy as me about their nails.",3
I used this nail polish remover today to remove some nail polish that was 3 layers deep and hard dried.  I first used a Kleenex and it wasn't abrasive enough so I changed to a paper towel and was able to get the polish off faster.  I really can't tell if this nail polish remover is any better than most other brands but it works well enough.,4
"This nail polish remover is not watered down like the cheap kind you buy at Wallmart.  This really got some old, thick nail polish off quickly and easily.  That said, I only had my toes painted so it was not really possible for me to stick my toes in the jar and rotate them so I took the sponge out, gave it a squeeze to get to the excess nail polish remover off and went to work with on my toes.  It was very easy and very fast.  This nail polish remover is at least 3x better than what I have in bottles underneath my bathroom sink.  I think as the nail polish remover is used up and/or evaporates I will refill it with more nail polish remover.  The pink sponge was soft, yet still rough enough to get the old nail polish off.  At first I was thinking this thing was going to be a bust, but it has turned out to be extremely useful.",5
"I like this sonic toothbrush a lot - the color is so retro pink and lovely and it seems to do as good a job as my expensive Phillips sonic toothbrush.  It has a tough case for traveling, sits nicely on it's charging stand and has 6 extra tooth brushes.  I just wish it took the same kind of toothbrushes as my Phillips sonic toothbrush.  They are so close to being the same size to fit, but the post on this toothbrush is too big for my replacement Phillips heads to fit.  So, replacement heads will have to be ordered specially and sometimes finding non-brand sonic toothbrush heads can be hard.  I have another sonic toothbrush that I love, but can't find any replacement toothbrush heads for it.  Other than the toothbrush heads, I think this is an awesome sonic toothbrush, does a great job (has lots of different settings but I only use one), and will make a retro bathroom look even more retro.",4
"I've never seen anything like these facial razors before so when they came up on my list of items I could review curiosity got the better of me.  That said, they aren't bad.  I'm at that age where I might spring an unwanted facial hair or two which I have to remove immediately upon detection.  I used (carefully!) one of these small razors to try shaving just a small area of my face and it really did remove all the peach fuzz.  I can't say that they are any better than a ladies electric facial shaver I've been using, but these would be a lot easier to carry in my purse just in case I needed to use one.  They seem well made and one razor should last a long time.  These are sharp, but kind of serrated at the edge so be careful with them.",4
This mask is very soft and molds itself around my bird beak nose pretty well.  I can still detect the tiniest bit of light but it's a lot better than any of my other masks I have for blocking out light.,4
"I've used this serum several times and I can't say I noticed any ""tightening"" or any smoothness occurring.  It looks cool in the bottle being gold-ish with sparkles, but it did little to help my face feel moisturized.  I have to go over it with a good moisturizer.  The little beads rubbed in o.k. but again, nothing really happened.",3
"I love the name - Cinnamon Roll! That's exactly what it looks like with a rich, glossy shine that isn't too tacky and stays on my lips for a long time. It applies smoothly with no clumping and I want to try other colors, it's so fun!",5
"I absolutely LOVE the colors in this hair, a mixture of honey, gold and auburn and I have received so many compliments on it. I am going to get more for sure! There is more than enough hair, eight packs for the crochet install and it is a great style for winter because it is warm too! The hair is thicker so it is also easy to remove and re-use if you want!",5
These crochet packs of hair are ready to use right out of the bag and are soft. The hair is of great quality with no tangling upon installation and looks even more perfect after sprayed with some oil sheen when done. I will definitely be using this hair again!,5
"I am so glad to have received these as I love perfume and when I travel I am not taking a very expensive bottle to the airport in order for it to be confiscated. So I just will these instead! Because there are five, you can decant your favorites (just spray into the empty bottle) and don't even need to fill it up all the way in order to have your favorite fragrances with you. Also great for people who make perfumes or want to decant samples for others!",5
"This is a good hand cream for winter, though the fragrance is much lighter than I'd hoped for a hand cream that needs to be applied often during winter after washing hands more frequently, etc. The cream itself provides nice protection though.",4
"Argan oil has a distinct but subtle scent, and it is the first thing I look for when using it. This passes the smell test and feels wonderful when I apply it to my face and hair. Because such a little goes a long way, it will last me some time and is a great buy.",5
"Ready to to get 2019 under swing with sure footing? This software suite is perfect for the small business with big goals and the features assure you can accurately assess where you are with your finances as you meet them. My brother is a real estate agent and while there are other industry-specific programs for that, he is really enjoying this QuickBooks so far because it allows him to track his expenses, listings aka inventory, commissions and taxes that must be precise with each transaction. Secure import of financials was a relief, and he was set up in about an hour or two and learning his way around the program with relative ease. He also has an assistant that he was able to easily add to the payroll and able to do so without the free support!<br /><br />Considering the list price on this new 2019 edition of Quickbooks is close to $500, the current offering is a steal and I recommend jumping on it before the price goes up again, as these sorts of offerings tend to fluctuate. QuickBooks is the most popular and affordable software compared to others on the market, and you do get what you pay for, so the value here is terrific too. I just began using the regular 2019 since I am on a smaller scale and this version is new to him, so I can't comment on the issues others are having. But considering the expense of upgrades and support on other platforms, this felt like the safest bet and I hope it stays that way!",5
I immediately washed this and put it in the freezer (just threw roll) and used after I got out of the shower and it really felt amazing. I rolled across my whole face for about 5 min until it felt nice and cool and then moisturized. This will definitely be apart of my routine for now on especially in the summer!,5
"It works really well, even in the dry and frigid winter air. Non-greasy and moisture rich.",5
"One pump produces a mound of foam (slightly smaller than a golf ball) that is like a thin shaving cream. It has very little scent, covers my face easily, and rinses well. My skin felt clean and smooth after use.",4
"The product itself is decent.<br />It reminds me of oil of olay. But it's about half the price has no scent. Feels nice, light weight and hydrating. More of a daily use face cream<br /><br />However, this was a two pack and I was only sent one.",2
works great at plumping up my lashes before putting on my mascara,5
Nice looking kit. couldn't find in local stores so ordered on line. work great. More tools then you will ever need. some I don't even know what there for.,5
"This is a handy set of stainless podiatrist style nail trimmers and tools that come in a zippered storage case, making it convenient for travel or storage.<br /><br />The set includes one curved clipper, one angled one, a lifter for ingrown nails, a pusher for cuticle care, and two different files for smooth finishing.  The angled main clipper has a non-adjustable internal tension spring and a coated ergonomic shaped hand grip, while the other clipper has a coated non-ergonomic shaped grip.<br /><br />When trying to cut through tough thick nails you need a sure grip. Unfortunately, the grip coating material used on these clippers is hard and not padded, therefore failing to provide cushioning to users with arthritis or to provide a non-slip grip.<br /><br />I tried these clippers on my father's thick toenails, and they do cut, but not as sharply or precisely as the professional grade clippers I usually use on his nails.  Instead of one clean cut, it took several clips to get through his tough nails with these and because of that the finish was jagged and needed filing to smooth out.<br /><br />Though I wouldn't recommend this set for seniors, I do think the curved shape of the larger clipper is a nice touch though, so they're useful enough for regular nails and handy to pack if you're planning a trip.",3
"This stainless steel pet comb is well made and sturdy enough to detangle my Maltese's long hair with ease. I've gotten it wet numerous times and upon air drying it hasn't shown any signs of rust, so the stainless appears to be of good quality. This comb is constructed well so it should last for years to come and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",5
I love these brushes they have made my artwork even better than what it was the blending with these brushes is absolutely wonderful,5
"It was a risk buying a random set of colors and of course I got mostly ugly ones, but this is by far the best polish out there and the price for the random set is great.",2
The brushes are great and good quality,5
Very cheaply made. The crayon keeps falling out. The colors are good. I am reminded that you get what you pay for,1
This drill is by far the best I've had yet...,5
Nice brush,4
I love this hair it’s very soft and the twist look very pretty but if you have a large head buy extra I had to buy and extra pack and I still didn’t have enough for my whole head by the time I spent money on extra packs I spent almost $90 so for me the price was kind of high I Never paid that much for synthetic hair I wish more twists came in each of the packs,4
Impossible to wear comfortably and the magnets should be spread out better for a more even or more realistic look because they are only on the ends.,2
"Other than the actual piece being a little small on my face it def makes breathing much better. Also, helps with fogging of glasses (if you wear them.)",5
"The original scent is pretty, but this particular batch is beyond shelf life.",2
I like the colors.,5
eyeshadow stays on all day,5
"I’ve used the lotion deodorant and ordered the stick to be less messy. Will see if this is as good.<br />Best ,most effective deodorant I’ve ever used. Not a great smell out of container but adjusts as it’s on your body.<br />It’s spendy but it truly amazing .<br />I do love the warm vanilla out of all the fragrances<br />I’m hoping the solid stick is a bit longer lasting . If it is it will be a better deal .",5
LOVE this stuff. We are the fairest of them all. Irish ancestry through and through.<br />Pretty sure I had sun poisoning. This stuff was the only thing that saved me. Its not sticky. It works immediately.<br />We do our best to not burn but it does happen. And this stuff rocks. There's even some with added lidocaine. Amazing.,5
Honestly I was very skeptical about this product because it was on the cheaper side and the reviews were up and down. I figured what the heck it’s not to expensive take a chance. I’m so glad I did. I put it on my eye brows every night before bed and apply some to the tip of my finger and put it on my upper lashes where eyeliner would go. I would say it does take a few weeks to see a difference but be patient and apply it every night and you won’t be disappointed. I get so many compliments on my eyelashes that people now think they are fake!! HahA!🤣,5
present for someone else......,4
I discovered nyx white eye shadow a few years ago. I fell in love because it's very pigmented which is exactly what I like. I do a lot of bold looks. Nothing else I've tried compares! I went to ulta beauty to buy more and that lady told me they completely stopped making the single pallet of white. I was so sad. Come to find out they didn't. When I came across this I was so happy. Might seem a little expensive for 1 tiny thing of it but all make up is expensive.  This is definitely worth it if u like ur white eyeshadow to be just that. Bright white!,5
My son loves these got them for him as a gift. Bought the pack just incase they did not hold up. But they do hold up. Strong and functional.,5
This came broken,1
Thought rollers worked on there osn,3
Love it,5
"Very hard to use, maybe it's just me.",2
The case is big but it is what I need to store the dyson and to keep it protected,5
"I'm updating my review because the nail lamp plug has eroded and rusted, not even a month after purchasing. It is an electronic, so I obviously never let it get in contact with water. I wouldn't recommend this buy because of this issue.",1
"Be aware the description says “gel” polish but they are not!  The colors are not even the nice ones on the picture.  They give you random colors, the unpopular ones for sure.",2
looks nothing like its supposed to,1
Beautiful colors. I'm happy!,5
My daughter didn't want to take these out even though they were quite heavy due to the length! She got plenty of compliments everywhere she went. I definitely recommend them.,5
Great value and sturdy combs. Great use and I recommend them!,5
Super hard brush I repeat very hard. This brush is not for the tender headed. I recommend a 4-6 week length before using this brush. I’m at a 3 1/2 week wolfs day the brush is still kinda hard. I’m sure i will get used to it but for now my blue 350 medium still has excellent pull!! Good quality and it has become expected since I own several of these brushes.,5
"Works great, worth the money, buy it, and you will never have to buy another brush!!",5
They are beautiful. The box is so cute it keeps everything in order. I would personally put them on before eye shadow that way the eyeliner will stick fully to your lid. You have to allow the eyeliner to dry fully. It doesn’t take as long as the glue. I like to use the tips on my nail to press a little on the magnets they stick with no problem they don’t lift. I love them. I definitely recommend and will buy again.,5
Use it everyday. Bye Bye puffy eyes!,5
Awesome,5
Great,5
No,3
It’s okay,3
"Burns my skin and they won’t stay on , not worth it",1
These are ok  but made very cheaply,4
Lashes were crushed unusable,1
It’s ok for a small fill but definitely not for a full nail,1
Won’t stay on,2
Best stuff ever,5
not too fond of the scent after tanning. I am really sensitive to smell though so maybe it is just me. Goes on really nice though.,4
"This Skin & Lab  Milky Serum is lightweight and unscented. I like the texture and feel of this serum - not sticky nor greasy but offers immediate hydration. It leaves the skin feeling soft and well hydrated.  The serum contains squalane and ceramides, providing moisture below the surface.",4
This body oil doesn't feel sticky or greasy on the skin. It hydrates but does leave a shine until the oil is absorbed.  It has a light lavender and citrus scent.,3
This Cica Green Cleanser comes in a gel form and is lightweight. It works well to remove layers of sunscreen without leaving my skin feeling stripped or overly dry.,5
"I'm new to the ITFER brand but I like the way this essence magnifies the other skincare products that I use.  The Essence is light with a gel like texture. It has no scent and doesn't dry out my skin. I use several pumps and tap it on a newly cleansed face.  It hydrates without causing any redness, irritation or sensitivity.<br /><br />After the essence, I use the Itfer Emulsion.  The Emulsion has a light citrus scent and shares the light gel texture. The Emulsion is easily absorbed into the skin without a sticky or oily feel.  It leaves the skin feeling hydrated.",5
"The Cell Fusion C sheet masks offer generous amounts of serum and hydrate the skin. My skin feels soft, hydrated and pampered with regular use of these sheet masks.",5
"I like the scent of coconut but was a little worried that the scrub would feel greasy on the skin.  It was comfortable and left my skin feeling softer without feeling dry or oily.  The scrub has large salt granules and these are slow to dissolve, I like this better than a sugar scrub.",5
This baby cologne is similar to lavender water in scent and feel. It comes in a plastic pump bottle and arrived in good condition. The baby cologne's scent dissipates fast but it smells and feels refreshing.,3
These eye patches are comfortable to use and help reduce puffiness and swelling.  They're a bit better than the travel packs since they feel more moist and seem to work longer.,4
This face cream is more liquid than cream. It doesn't feel sticky or greasy on the skin and is absorbed quickly. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.  The cream does have a strong scent similar to tulips. I like the feel of the cream but not the scent.,3
"Amorepacific is a well known Korean skincare brand and I've had very good experiences with the different high end lines of this company.  Enough Project is a new ""accessible"" and less expensive line that uses clean beauty ingredients.<br /><br />The peeling pack goes on easily and crumbles as you rub it on your face.  It exfoliates gently using plant extracts.  I have combination sensitive skin and my skin is adjusting to the seasons changing.  I was worried that the peeling pack would be too strong but I didn't experience any redness, sensitivity or irritation.  Instead my skin felt softer and receptive to moisturizer, essence, etc.",5
"I'm  new to the Zeriod brand but have had very good experience with Japanese and Korean skincare brands and products. This Zeriod Dermarenewal Revitalizing Ampoule is geared towards sensitive and combination skin. The tube is small but I only need a little drop. The ampoule is quickly absorbed into the skin and protects and hydrates.  It is for additional protection to the skin after a procedure, so I don't use it daily.  Instead, I would use it after a facial or an intense exfoliation.",5
I find these cloth hairbands comfortable.  I tried using them while jogging and they stayed in place and kept sweat from my face.  The floral prints are pretty and ones that I'd choose again.,4
"This Hibiscus Moisturizing Scalp Pack is used after shampooing. Unlike a conditioner, the scalp pack focuses on the scalp and hydrates without feeling heavy or greasy. It leaves the scalp feeling clean, light and not dry.",5
"These hair masks really helped my hair.  They didn't leave my scalp or hair feeling greasy but they did leave my hair feeling soft and silky.  I put my hair in a ponytail and then put on the cap with conditioner. The tape took some getting used to but once it was set up, the cap was comfortable. The conditioner/mask stayed in place and didn't drip.  I kept it on longer than the 20 minutes and after rinsing, my hair felt so good.",4
"The wipes have a strong lemon scent and use natural ingredients.  The pack has 20 individually wrapped wipes that can be used on the skin or to clean in the home.  They're not chemical disinfectant wipes, I mainly use them for my hands, etc and nearby surfaces when traveling because I enjoy the strong natural lemon scent. I have sensitive skin and they didn't cause any irritation or redness or sensitivity.",4
These exfoliating mitts are strong but work well.  They're Korean style exfoliating mitts which are different from the usual drugstore type. They're made of lightweight material that dries quickly but shouldn't be put in the dryer.  They are also much rougher than the regular ones and provide excellent if strong exfoliation. I usually use them on dry skin first and then wet them with shower gel for maximum effect. I rinse them out and airdry them.  They help keep skin soft.,5
"This 5-pack of Shinsiaview Vita Essence are well packaged and easy to transport when traveling.  I like the light cooling feel of the essence which is easily absorbed into the skin. It moisturizes without making my skin feel shiny or sticky.  It left my skin feeling well hydrated and soft.<br /><br />I have combination sensitive skin and experienced no redness, sensitivity or irritation using this product.",5
"These rubber masks do require more work and cause considerably more mess than the regular sheet masks.<br /><br />However, as far as rubber masks go, these are relatively easy to use and remove. The rubber mask stayed on thicker and were easier to peel off than some of the ones I'd used previously.  The feel and texture of these masks light, cold and rubbery. Once I remove the masks, my skin doesn't feel sticky at all.  The masks hydrate and are light on the skin.",4
"I always have lotion on hand so these individually packed tubes of lotion from South Korea are a good fit for me.  I like the feel and texture of the lotion - non greasy and effective. As a lotion, it is excellent but the scents are not particularly attractive. I've tried the Olive and the Green Tea scented versions and am not particularly drawn to the scents. The green tea is a bit too sweet and doesn't smell like green tea, so I've deducted 1 star.",4
"This set has four individually packaged travel sized tubes of hand lotion from South Korea.  The lotion light, non-greasy and is quickly absorbed into the skin. While the scent is a little sweet for my taste, I love the feel and texture of the lotion.  It doesn't have the lotion feel after a few minutes but my hands stay well hydrated and soft.",4
"I'm always interested in trying new skincare products, brands, and innovations. I'm new to the Ogana Cell brand but knowing that the brand is created by a South Korean dermatologist caught my attention. I have had very good experience with South Korean skincare at different price points.<br /><br />This Amazing Lotion has a light texture, similar to a serum. I have combination sensitive skin and need anti-aging products.  I found that this worked very well for me.  There is a light fruity scent but the lotion doesn't feel sticky or oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin. It looks matte but hydrates well and left my skin feeling very soft.  The lotion strengthens the skin barrier but doesn't have the slightly oily feel of many products that have the same purpose.  I also like that the lotion helps to increase collagen -- at my age this makes a difference.",5
"I was late to use sunblock regularly.  The older versions were too whitish and thick, uncomfortable on the skin.  This South Korean version with 50 SPF is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not leave any whitish color or streaks.  It does not feel oily or sticky but instead more like a light lotion.  It does not use parabens - the product list shows the harsh ingredients that the sunscreen does not contain.  Aside from SPF, the sunblock also has moisturizing ingredients.  It is easy to use this everyday without causing a breakout or irritation of the skin.",5
 Truly relaxing with its soothing lavender scent and natural oils!  I use it after my shower and it makes my skin soft and well-nourished.  This gives me a feeling of relaxation and being pampered.  It is also smooth and very easy to apply. ,5
"This Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream doesn't have the usual cream texture, instead it is firm.  But the cream is quick to soften when rubbed into the skin.  It provides deep hydration and doesn't feel greasy or sticky. I find it particularly suited to the cold months when the indoor air is hot and dry.  I have combination sensitive skin and this cream caused no redness, irritation or sensitivity.",5
"I've been using sheet masks for years and these masks have a lovely texture. There are generous amounts of serum and the mask stays moist for over 20 minutes.<br /><br />Overall, these are a great complement to the other skincare products and sheet masks that I use regularly.  I have sensitive combination skin and this did not cause any redness, sensitivity or irritation.<br /><br />If this was helpful to you, please indicate it below.",5
"I always take time to pamper my skin, no matter how busy I am.  Thirty minutes is all it takes.  Whenever I use this Avajar face mask, I feel calm and relaxed.  Above all, it provides deep hydration that soothes and is truly nourishing. I have sensitive combination skin and did not experience any redness or irritation or sensitivity.",5
"I'm relatively new to the Hanhoo brand. I'd previously tried their pimple patches and sheet masks but this $45 set is geared towards an older, more skincare oriented client.  The packaging is giftable with six items for layering skin care (the English list of ingredients are on the plastic wrap).  I found the products light and easily absorbed into the skin. I have sensitive combination skin and they worked well for me. They cleansed without stripping my skin and hydrated without being overly strong.  I experienced no redness, sensitivity or irritation while using any of the products.",5
"I've liked the different Alteya products that I'd tried but this Rose Face Sunscreen doesn't work well for me.  The texture is nice, light and doesn't feel greasy.  It offers mineral protection against UVA and UVB rays. I'm Asian and  find that the rose tint is a little strong for my skin tone.  While I can use a little and blend it in, there are other tinted and non-tinted sunscreens that are a better fit for my needs.  Similarly, someone with a more compatible skintone might find this to be a perfect match.",3
"I decided to pamper myself and enjoy the luxurious feel of this body oil and fingernail moisturizer. Oh-la-la, this lotion is so soft and light, with a very subtle and fresh, clean smell.  It  hydrates the skin so well, using mainly organic material - plant & flower oils, some coming from the Pacific islands.",4
"I've tried a few oxygen whip cleansers and this compares well with the famous Japanese brands.  The cleanser is light but very effective. A little portion lathers well and deep cleanses. It left my skin feeling deeply clean but not stripped or too dry.  At a reasonable price, this is a reliable product and one that I'll reorder in the future.",5
"I am always interested in trying new skincare brands, products, and innovations. I'm new to the Carla brand but have had very good experience with South Korean skincare in the past.  I loved this cream!  It has a light scent and a lovely texture. The cream is not greasy or sticky but it hydrates deeply and well.  I would definitely purchase this again and am interested in learning more other skincare items by Carla",5
"I have good skin but the area under my eye tends to be puffy.  I have started to use this product, applying these marine patches under my eyes and massaging the serum in afterwards to soothe and de-puff the area.  I am very happy with the way they gently tighten my skin.",5
"I'm always interested in trying new skincare products, brands, and innovations.  Mizon is a well regarded South Korean skincare brand and its cleansing balm was gentle but effective.  It comes solid in the jar with a small scoop that helps keep your fingers from touching the balm.  After rubbing the balm together it turns liquid and goes on gently into the skin. I rubbed it further into my skin to help it cleanse deeply. The cleansing balm didn't feel greasy or sticky.  I  left it on for a few minutes and rinsed. My skin felt clean and very soft.  It caused no irritation or sensitivity.",5
This sheet mask felt lovely on the skin.  The sheet mask is thick and generous with serum. The serum was gentle and did not cause any sensitivity or irritation.  The mask itself hydrates deeply and stayed damp for over 20 minutes.  It left my skin feeling soft and pampered.,5
My skin has become more sensitive over time and the cold weather and dry air during winter exacerbates the condition.  This Easydew Starter Cleansing Milk works very gently and is effective at cleaning.  My skin doesn't feel stripped or dry and the ceramides increase hydration so that my skin feels soft after cleansing even without toner or moisturizer.<br />I have sensitive skin and the cleanser did not cause redness or irritation or sensitivity.,5
"I've used retinol products, both OTC and prescribed by my dermatologist.  I've been careful to only use retinol at night and to avoid direct sunlight after using retinol.  This serum does not specifically warn against going under direct sun, but it is worth taking the precaution.<br /><br />I liked the texture of the Face Oil Retinol Serum - it feels like a dry oil and is easily absorbed into the skin. It doesn't feel oily or sticky but it moisturizes. It helps improve the firmness and tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and did not experience any redness, irritation, or sensitivity using this.",4
"I'm always interested in trying new skincare products, brands, and innovations.  Mizon is a well regarded South Korean skincare brand.  Vitamin C serum loses efficacy when it is exposed to oxygen, Mizun uses Arbutin to lengthen the efficacy of the serum.<br /><br />Topical Vitamin C sometimes  irritates my skin but I had no sensitivity to this.  It did go on easily with no greasiness or tacky feel.  It does feel like it tightens my skin and gives it a more even, brighter tone.",5
"I'm always interested in trying new skincare products, innovations, and brands.  The brand was created by a dermatologist and the serum does feel lovely on the skin.  This serum uses  plant-based nutrients and antioxidants to hydrate, maintain elasticity, and combat aging. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin without any greasiness or tackiness.  My skin felt well hydrated, soft, and lifted.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and had no irritation, redness or sensitivity when using this product.",5
"I chose the Baby Powder Scent which brings back memories of babies and childhood.  My skin felt instantly clean and soft.  It is made of natural nourishing ingredients and provides relief from dryness.  The scent really brings comfort - I'm looking for that sort of soothing scents nowadays.  The packaging is old fashioned with flower, lambs, etc.",4
"I'm always interested in trying new skincare products, brands, and innovations. The Caudalie products are among those often discussed by beauty bloggers and are prominent on ""what skincare to buy when you visit France""  lists.  This set has their famous vinosource serum that contains the antioxidants from grape seeds.  This Vinosource serum smells lovely, is quickly absorbed into the skin, and hydrates deeply. It's a lightweight and effective serum that leaves my skin feeling pampered and very soft.  It works very well during the dry cold months of autumn and winter.<br /><br />The cleanser is gentle but effective.  The moisturizing cream has a lovely scent and the antioxidants that have made the brand famous.  It is particularly welcome during the cold, dry months.  I love that Caudalie's products work so well.  I have sensitive skin but these products have not caused me sensitivity or irritation or redness.<br /><br />The set is beautifully packaged and would be a lovely gift.",5
"I'm always happy to try new skincare products, brands, and innovations. I've used sheet masks for years and am familiar with the benefits of ginseng but these masks use ginseng topically.<br /><br />The sheet masks are thick, generous with serum, and hydrate without feeling sticky. I liked the feel of the sheetmask and that it didn't have any additional material or cover sheet. The mask hydrates and is relaxing. The instructions suggest using the mask for 20 min but I wore it for 75 min without it drying out.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin but experienced no redness, irritation, or sensitivity.",5
"I'm always interested in trying different skincare innovations. products and brands.  I've been using different sheet masks for years and find them effective at pampering my skin.<br /><br />I hadn't tried this brand KOEC before but was very happy with the quality of the Cucumber Essence Masks.  They are individually packed and I prefer to cool them in the fridge before using.  The mask is very soft and holds moisture well. It also has plenty of serum and the mask lasted for over 20 minutes without drying.<br /><br />The Cucumber Essence is soothing and hydrating.  It left my skin feeling very soft without feeling sticky.  I have sensitive skin and experienced no redness, sensitivity or irritation using this product.",5
"I am always interested in trying new skincare innovations, products and brands.  I am new to the Laloirelle brand and  was intrigued by the description of this Luminous Face Oil.  I'd used different face oils in the past with varying success.  I have oily skin in parts (T zone) and sensitive skin.<br /><br />This Luminous Face Oil combines several high quality antioxidants to help moisten and brighten the skin.  I found the face oil was not quickly absorbed into the skin.  I would prefer to use this at night because of the time it takes for the oil to be absorbed.  I did wake up with well hydrated skin. Considering the high cost of this face oil, I had expected it to standout. I may have to use it for an extended time before I feel or see results.<br /><br />I did not experience any redness, irritation or sensitivity.",4
"I'm always interested in trying new skincare innovations, products and brands. I'm new to Follain and find this mattifying moisturizer to be effective and high quality. The moisturizer is a little thick and hydrates deeply without feeling greasy or oily at all.  It does take a while for all of the moisturizer to be fully absorbed but it leaves my face feeling very soft and hydrated.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin but noticed  no sensitivity, redness or irritation.",5
"I'm always interested in trying new skincare innovations, products and brands.  I'm new to this American brand MD Complete but found the Vitamin C serum nicely packaged and high quality.<br /><br />I use different serums in the morning and at night. This Vitamin C is a little thicker than what I usually use and is feels a bit oily -- but going on it is absorbed quickly and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy.  I would use it at night though.  It felt deeply hydrating and the Vitamin C helps brighten and even out skin tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin but did not experience any irritation, sensitivity or redness using this product.",4
"This lipid facial oil comes quite pricey at $70 but it also gives you a large portion of 60 ml or 2 oz.  Most of my serums come in 1 oz bottles, so while $70 is high it is not outrageous.<br /><br />The facial oil is made in the USA and contains Resveratrol which helps combat aging.  Resveratrol comes from grapes and has strong antioxidants.  This Essential Lipid Power Infusion also contains argan oil, rose hip oil, and a mix of extracts.<br /><br />I found this Essential Lipid Power Infusion to stay on my skin for a relatively long time. It left my skin feeling a bit greasy but once absorbed it felt very soft and well hydrated.  I agree with the other reviewers that recommend using this in the evening because of the time that it takes for the oil to be absorbed.",5
"This is a very small tube but the sunblock works well and is small enough that I can bring it everywhere, even on long bike rides. I love the stick medium - the sunblock was easy to apply and to smooth on without getting your hands dirty.  It can get to the tough angles around the eyes and the nose. The sunblock is thicker than usual but effective. It has a great smell and not greasy.  One application lasts reasonably long even when I exercise.  It is important to reapply sunblock especially to do so frequently on hot and sunny days.<br /><br />I didn't have any redness or irritation or sensitivity when using the sunblock.",5
"I love trying new skincare products and brands from overseas. I've found French skincare products to be particularly innovative and high quality even when they are not expensive. Caudalie is well known internationally and has a spa in New York City's Plaza Hotel.  It's products are among those always listed in a search of ""what skincare should I buy while in Paris"" or ""What items should I buy at at French pharmacy?""<br /><br />This travel kit with the favorite products is a relatively inexpensive way to try a range of Caudalie skincare and their distinctive ingredients. The brand is known for their use of the grapeseeds from a vineyard and discovering the antioxidants help to combat aging and free radicals.  This kit has some of their more expensive creams in small doses, so you can try the range of creams (Vinoperfect, Premier Cru, Vinosource and the famous Beauty Elixir and Instant Foaming Cleanser.  It comes in a zippered tote perfect for traveling.  I love this set and plan to get one for my mother. While we can't travel during this covid pandemic, we can look forward to traveling together in the future. It's a gift of skincare and a promise of future adventures.",5
"I have found my skin has become more sensitive in my 40s and with all the additional washing and bathing because of Covid 19.  I'm new to this brand but found this Cica cream to work very well. It immediately cooled and soothed my irritated skin without any greasiness or oiliness. It was quickly absorbed into the skin.  It left my skin feeling much softer, less irritated, soothed. It is something I plan to keep on hand.",5
"This cleanser comes in a simple, colorful, & attractive red-and-white package.  It spreads well over the skin and has a light feel.  A little of it really goes a long way.<br /><br /> It is easy to remove and makes one feel fresh and clean after application.<br /><br />The one drawback is that instructions are not given in English (only in Korean) so one is left unsure whether it needs rinsing or wiping it up with tissue is enough.  There needs to be an  English translation on the box in order to reach the international market.",5
I use a pea-sized portion which I mix until it froths. I apply the foam to my face and let it stand briefly before rinsing it off.  It leaves my skin feeling deep cleansed but not squeaky dry.  I have not had any sensitivity or redness or irritation.  It works well with my regular toner and serum.,4
This cream hydrates but feels very light on the skin.  It has glycolic acid helps exfoliate without causing me any redness or sensitivity or irritation.  I like the texture and the light citrus scent.,5
"My quartz roller worked well. I washed it carefully first and then used the larger roller for my forehead, cheeks and chin. The smaller roller worked well under my eyes.  I liked the feel of the rollers as they massaged my face.  They did make a slight squeaky sound but they held up well.  It is similar to a face massage but very easy to do while relaxing at home. At this price, it is a reasonble buy.",4
"This AG Hair Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar is relatively expensive at $20 for a small bottle, but it is made of natural ingredients like apple cider vinegar, organic argan oil and protein from quinoa.  The spray is supposed to refresh the scalp and the hair, to reduce irritation to the scalp and to help soften hair.  I have been trying different scalp treatments and was eager to see how this would work.  It is less of a scalp treatment and more of a hair refresher but it does add bounce and lift to my hair.",4
"I love this lamp! This lamp has both UV & LED lights. There are three timer settings; 30, 60, & 90 seconds plus has a sensor that will automatically turn on the lamp when you insert your fingers/toes.<br />The plate on the bottom is removable if you use it for toes.  I would absolutely order this again if I needed to!",5
"It's OK as sometimes it doesn't turn on and you have to keep messing w it. The light always comes on, just not the motor.",3
I haven't tried the rhinestones bands yet. I love the designs on the fabric bands. The bands fit great nice quality and wasn't tight  I can't wait to wear the others.,5
Great jars for cosmetics such as body butters.,5
I absolutely love this spray bottle. I wanna throw all my cheap plastic spray bottles in the garbage.  It saturate your hair in just a few sprays. Love it!,5
Very cheap!!!! I went and purchased a automatic brush washer.,1
Loved it was exactly what I was looking for it is easily adjustable n soft bendy material her 1st bday was a success,5
Great quality. Not overly shiny and looks real. Easy to use. Love it,5
Grand  daughter loves it,5
LOVE this scent even with my allergies I'm okay. I only use Clear gel. Watch sizes vs price of deodorants through Amazon this is not the only brand I have found you think you are getting good price vs store but they are smaller.,4
Not silk and it’s cheap material that tears,1
"Perfect for parting, made parting my 4c hair easier and neater, also surprisingly sturdy.",5
This worked perfectly for my 4c hair and made wash day so much easier!,5
Silicone is nice and soft and definitely gets those hard to reach places,5
Buenos,5
weird vanilla smell....,3
"My son loves it,",5
Good quality hair looks gorgeous on my daughter. She just loves the easy to care of soft and silky curls.,5
"Extremely flimsy, not easy to get through the hair and my daughter doesn’t have thick hair. Rather disappointing we have tried 3 times and they bend incorrectly and the hair comes out. Whaaaawhawhaa",2
Very tasty and fun too might I add. It is a little messy if mixed with body fluids and will stain hotel sheet lol so use wisely. I highly recommend!!,5
"Nice earrings, great for price considering you get 3 pair. Only problem is gages are bigger than normal piercing earrings from like WalMart or Claires. They are nearly twice (2×) the size so I do not really recommend for young children. It tends to be uncomfortable. I actually removed from my cartilage (pierced 17yrs.) due to discomfort",4
Arrived on time and product was exactly as described! Very satisfied with purchase!,5
"These brushes are perfect for design, even some for Joe application. Good price and good quality",5
Has a bad smell. Smells like old stale water. I replace the water every day and I still can’t get rid of the smell.,1
Love it just wish it was silk or  polyester,3
Poor quality,1
Exactly what's expected...,5
Love The Color & It Detangles my Hair,5
"Love Love Love This Bonnet . The Material Is Excellent, Keeps Your Hair Style Intact, Silky On The Inside, Go For It!!",5
Love,5
i love these! its my first time using these sponges and i love them! and they're easy to clean,5
I bought  them for my self  so glad I did. I believe a new make up teen should  use a different  kind.,5
Love this spray and has a natural hold.,5
great for trimming cuticles that are rough,5
I love the way it detangles my hair and the strength it gives it.,5
the colors don't sure properly and aren't the same color as they seem to be,1
This style is very youthful and the coloring just right for me.  The cap is very lightweight and easy to adjust.  The wig comes with a net to wear over your own hair.  I recommend wearing it so the wig has a base to grip on to.  I also bought the wig brush and comb recommended with the purchase.  I am very satisfied!  No more bad hair day worries!,5
These towels are awesome. They exfoliate and clean your body/skin like no other. Excellent quality and they last forever. You will never use a washcloth again,5
"When I first got it I was shocked at how small the bottle was! Like mini sized. I felt ripped off. But then I got around to using it and I really like it. The color changing is cool. Pink when it's warm and orange when it's cool, red when cold.",5
Was a gift for my daughter. She loved them. She uses them everyday.,5
"These are SUPER sharp.  I have used this kind of clippers for over a decade.  When I first opened these, I felt like they were so sharp that I could do some serious damage.  Either I'm used to them now, or they have dulled just a tiny bit, but they are wonderful.  TEN TIMES better than anything I have ever bought from a store.  I have really bad ingrown toenails in one of my big toes, but I have removed both of them with these.  What relief!!  Be sure to keep the little plastic tip-protector that comes with it.  It protects the tip of the blades when they are stuck in a drawer.  It also prevents you from getting poked with it accidentally.",5
Didn't realize it was only 2 inches wide. Need 3 inches. Gave too my granddaughter she loves them. Have to may attention and read everything before  i order.,4
Good,5
A Staple! Smooth on the eyes and stays on throughout the day.,5
"Returned! It would've been good except, the location of the Heat Setting is directly on the Grip of the Iron.  Thus, every time you touch the handle you end up CHANGING the SETTING!  And that can be disastrous if the Changed Setting is Too HOT!",1
"I had a sample size of this, loved it so much I bought the big one. The formula must’ve changed cuz the big one was totally different and doesn’t work",3
Sensitive skin? Beware of Lume! I haven't used it in a week and I am still hurting from when I did use it.,1
"I honestly  hate these, none of the sized fit right and they will not glue down with out an air pocket, they dont sit sight on the nails, the plastic is think. ut when they are tri.med or filed it flakes in layers so you will get lots of snags",1
"Its a little light so be careful not to knock it over; maybe glue some weights on the underside? Other than that, its a great product and a great price to match that.",5
"I would order again,  fast shipping and as described",5
"I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT,  IT MADE A WONDERFUL GIFT TO AUNTS, COUSINS,NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS.  I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOME MORE FOR HERE AT HOME.",5
"Used this on two pairs of boots. Took some of the color off of a brand new pie of brandy-colored smooth leather. Managed to not add any shine to the smooth leather, which is good. Refreshed my old pair of work steel toes.",4
Awesome as always.,5
Love this product. Will continue to shave with this FOREVER!,5
Love this color!  Its beautiful on. Perfect mild mustard.,5
"Feel it is a great dupe for the overpriced BOOM STICK. I have enjoyed using it. It adds the glow or frost if you will, but is not heavily frosty and does not have any glitter. It is perfect for older women's wrinkled eyes. I would definitely purchase this product again.",5
A bit tight and I have a smaller head than some lol,4
"This stuff is excellent. The smell is absolutely amazing. This takes me back to my childhood and the honeysuckle in our back yard. While I wouldn't want to smell like this all day since it isn't very masculine, it is great to enjoy while I shave. The soap is slick and performs great. This is a top notch product.",5
"I have about 10 razors. I have been in search of better and better shaves. My Feather AS-D2 is awesome and smooth but perhaps a bit too mild. I fine even the Merkur 34C a little too aggressive for my skin. The Merkur Futur is horrible for me and is a paperweight for anyone who prefers mild razors. The iKon B1 slant is a perfect balance. Not too aggressive, and with a light touch it gave me a very smooth shave. I normally do 3 passes and then touch up areas that need it. I had 5 days growth when I shaved with this razor head today. I was amazed when I finished my first pass. It looked like I had done two passes with my other razors. I normally do with the grain, cross-grain, and then lightly against the grain.<br />With the B1 I did a with-the-grain pass and one very light across-the-grain pass and it looked like I was done shaving. I did a touch-up in one or two spots and I called it good. An against the grain pass would have left me absolutely BBS but that usually gives me ingrown hairs. Oh, by the way, no nicks, weepers, or irritation at all. The head is shaped very weird with the slant design but I was able to shave under my nostrils with ease; much better than most, actually! I really am impressed with this head.<br />I can't wait to do another shave tomorrow.<br />My shave:<br />iKon B1 head<br />iKon OSS handle from my 101<br />Persona Lab Blue blade (2nd shave on the blade)<br />Stirling Soap Co. British Leather shaving soap<br />Stirling Soap Co. Coniferous Pre-Shave oil",5
"This cream product is so thin and virtually weightless on the skin, and unlike many more organic oil based cream blushes, this blush is not tacky or oily to touch. I find the ideal way to apply this blush is by dipping your beauty blender into the pan. My personal favorite color is the lilac, as it's a nice cool-toned muted baby pink color. I hope amazon never stops carrying this product. I will repurchase this forever. FYI, my skin type is usually sensitive and this has never broken me out.",5
"This product is not suitable as highlighter if one is very pale. Also, the finish is not natural but glittery/shimmery bordering chunky. The bronzer will cling to any areas of the skin where one has peach fuzz/tiny hairs thus making the application process a pain.",1
"I wish I could give this more stars.  I wish that it helped me grow long, thick, lush eyelashes.  But that is not the case.  There is very, very, very little product in the tube -- and it is extremely difficult to apply using the brush provided, particularly given the caution that you need to avoid touching skin when applying the product.  This might work for someone, but it certainly did not work for me.",2
"I don't know why Made in France barrette fixings are so superior to anything made in the United States -- they certainly look the same and mechanically, they function the same, but for some reason, the French barrettes are just a whole lot better.  They don't pull or catch my hair, they don't stretch out of shape, they don't break and bend.  I know this is a lot of $$ to spend on a barrette when you can get one for a fraction of this price at your corner drug store, but these France Luxe barrettes are worth it.  This coral colored scallop design is beautiful, and the barrette hold a lot of hair.  This is definitely for thick hair.  France Luxe also makes boule style barrettes for fine hair -- so if you don't have a thick mop, I would check out the other France Luxe designs.  These are expensive for what they are, but they're beautiful and long-lasting.  And they work, always important in a barrette.  I can put this barrette in my hair and it stays put all day.",5
It does help in lubricating the blades and getting a smoother shave.,4
"After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn't last that long and I could seldom get an acceptable shave around the neck. The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).<br /><br />It comes with a travel ""sarcophagus"" (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.<br /><br />The only negatives are that it's quite a bit noisier than the 7120, but then again that is quite quiet... I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin... But then again we all different facial features... And it's pricey... I'm still kicking myself for not buying this when it came out as a special deal... But I needed it too much to wait for another one to show up.",5
"Update 20/02/10<br /><br />After a year and a half of good service my HQ7140 would not start even with the cord plugged in, unless I left it connected for a couple of hours...Obviously not an option when you're trying to get to work. I was about to order another one, already cursing for having to go back to blades even if only temporarily; but before that I took it to a specialized shop; they opened it and showed me it was wet on the inside and told me the ""circuit"" was fried. I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water. They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water... They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a ""Low"" red light.<br /><br />The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9... It was only when the 7140 failed that I realized just how much I depend on it and how well it has worked out - my technique still needs to improve and shaving still seems to take too long but no going back to blades for me!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />As a wet shaving refugee I didn't know what to expect; I was just tired of getting cuts everyday, and paying an exhuberant tax to the wet shaver companies; I didn't want to buy a top of the line model in case things didn't work out.<br /><br />This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I'm getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.<br /><br />The battery's first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn. The battery light starts blinking when it's fuly charged, by the way.<br /><br />I have the Philips branded verion of this and it still says Made in Holland...",4
"I used some of this to make DIY Stevia Glycerite.  It worked.  This is a LOT of pure glycerin, glad I've got it;  hard to find in a store.",5
This is a fabulous drink of moisture and youth for my skin. I'm using about once a week.  I love how my skin looks and feels.,5
"Just started using this, but I am very impressed. I had some issues on my scalp that I've bee trying to clear up for years, (yes Years!).  I dropped this castor oil on the spots at night with a q-tip.  The problem has completely gone away.  Thank YOU!",5
"These work great, just like any 'thai deoderant crystal', same stuff. They are a little 'rough' at first,  a use or two makes them smooth. You get 3+ pieces to make the weight,  packed in a box. So all in all a good deal if this method works for you! Also, since you're getting a few pieces, you won't be caught short when it inevitably smacks the tile bathroom floor and shatters 😅",5
"Got this kit on sale for under $20, which is an absolute steal! I guess TOBS discontinued the scent, so the supplier was clearing out inventory.<br /><br />It's a cologne-type scent with a modern vibe. The shave cream performs like other TOBS shave creams, which is a good thing. Easy to build a lather, reasonably slick and protective. The cream is harder than other TOBS creams I've used, but that doesn't affect performance in the least.<br /><br />The kit also comes with a badger brush and a cologne. The brush is actually pretty good! It's black badger hair, so the bristles are relatively stiff/scritchy, but I prefer that. Had the typical badger funk for the first few shaves, but now it's neutral. No lost bristles yet, so it seems like a quality brush/knot.<br /><br />The cologne is also nice, a matching scent to the shave cream. I find that it lasts 2-3 hours on my skin. It's a good office/professional scent: pleasant, inoffensive. Probably not going to turn any heads.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, $20 for this kit is a great value!",5
Worked great. Just like the one in the salon where I go.It really increases the curliness of my hair.,5
Cute curls and easy to use.,5
It does stay in place👍,5
Luv the color,5
This product comes with a brow razor and stencils for filling in eyebrows.  The color chestnut is good for brown browns & it goes on nicely without being too heavy a color.,5
Nice color and helps make lashes look fuller and lusher,4
Love the color,5
"I was a bit disappointed when I saw how small the tubes were, but I discovered that I only need a very tiny, pin-head sized dot to add just the right amount of color to my face.<br />Two of the three colors are too pink for me, but the one is just right.<br />Very pleased.",4
"Great colors - easy to use! Washes out easily on virgin hair, takes a couple washes with treated hair.  I did use hair spray to &#34;set&#34; the colors",5
"Very pleasant feeling let after using the roller every night. Used it only a week now, bought second one, to roll simultaneously on both sides as the stone gets warmer very fast. Beautiful rose quartz, high quality set.",5
"Anything with original Thieves Oil is A-OK with me.<br />I cannot tolerate most smells or synthetic smells, but all natural Thieves smells delicious.<br />I often put a drop of the oil under my nose when I am going to be around sick people or traveling.<br />A must if you are going to be flying on a plane.<br />I Also put a few drops in a fine spray bottle of cheap Vodka to use as air freshener or on linens.<br />Oil mixes better with an alcohol base.<br />There are knock off of these products around, but they are a waste of money.<br />Only original Thieves via Young Living is the way to go. Love I can get them Prime via Amazon.",5
Perfect combination to stay healthy.,4
"I’ve bought everything from Covergirl to Chanel; cheapest to priciest.  I’ve sampled so many - volumizing, lifting, lengthening… the so called hypoallergenic ones have even made my eyes itchy and red.  After seeing the reviews, I decided to try these.  Yup.  I’ll only use these now.  Easy application, my eyes look pretty, not clumpy and it also doesn’t look like a tarantula crawling across my eyelids.  At this price point, I can get a new one when I’m supposed to, not milk my old ones because they were so darn pricey.  I used the waterproof on the beach in Mexico drinking margaritas all day.  Yup.  Love it",5
Thankfully I didn’t spend too much on these. You’d be better off using them as chip clips.,1
Nice product,5
very disapointed with smell!,1
"Once I received it, I used it!  It works great! I'm not a seasoned stamper as I've only done it a couple times, but this has been great to use.  It's very flexible and easy to clean. You can view the image you picked up from all sides. Top, side, bottom. I love that I can see the image and where I will be stamping it before stamping my finger. (I had a Konad stamper before which is not clear or jelly so you have to remember where you picked up the image or you miss where you want to put it). I only have Pueen nail plates so this stamper was used with Pueen nail plates.<br />If you have not used a stamper and nail plates before, please look up instructions such as on Youtube. My tips are to ensure the stamper and nail plate are 100% clean without polish on them each time you stamp. I will post a photo as soon as I learn how to on Amazon mobile.",5
"Very pretty. Looks just like the photo. Also has a nice scent. I am using it for decoration only, so I can't say how it works as a shower or bath soap. Comes shrink wrapped in plastic for protection.",4
"Quality product, sturdy. Textured, flexible tip.",4
Perfect. I purchased these to help compartmentalize my big first aid kit.<br />They are not real robust but since I don't expect to be opening and closing the zippers a lot should be fine.,4
These wipe perform as expected  I keep them handy close to my computer screens and for my glasses.,5
What have I been missing??? Love the packaging of all three and am amazed at the results of my hair!,5
I really like these clips so I bought another package of them.,5
These really are the perfect travel size and perfect for essential oil sprays that you may want to make and carry with you.  Would buy again.,5
"I could tell as soon as I opened it, it was fake. There was a ring of some kind of liquid around the outer layer of the product, it smells & feels like they took a cheap lotion (chemical smell & super greasy/sticky) & added faint lavender scent to it & there’s WAY too much purple shimmer in there (is what they used even skin safe??). I mixed it up hoping to make it better but nope, this is definitely a fake. It also gives me a little stinging/hot sensation, like an allergic reaction. Unfortunately, I just started college & no longer have the money to drop at Sephora for the real thing so I guess I’m stuck with this for now & have to cross my fingers & pray it doesn’t give me cancer or skin problems from bad ingredients. Please don’t buy this if you can afford to go to Ulta or Sephora!",1
Always have this on hand for scar wounds from many surgeries. Works great,5
They are to long for my taste. The description was off. I do however like the value for the product. The lashes are great quality.,2
I purchased this as part of a gift and recipient was very happy.,5
Works,4
"looks great, works great.",4
"it seems like this is made for women with gigantic heads.  Only the middle part is adjustable, but the other 2 lanes are static and too long.",3
They are capable of holding a lot of hair or just a bit.  It is a good size for anytime of day or night.  They hold the hair very well.,5
"I like that it is stainless steel, compact and easy to store and clean. My only complaint is that I feel like the ends can be sharper. It is a little blunt to my liking, I have to put some force to scrape my tongue.",4
"Introduced to this fragrance in 2014. I use one fragrance for  years. When in my closet, car or bed I want Tom Ford tobacco Vanille scent. Incredible worth every penny.",5
I have a 3 pound dog who hates having her teeth brushed and it's always hard to do that but this brush works extremely well. It has a lot of bristles also which makes a huge difference. I definitely recommend this toothbrush for small dogs.,5
I like the smell of this perfume but it doesn't last at all so I won't be repurchasing this,5
This arrived in a timely manner and it was my husband's choice.,5
It’s just too thick to do anything,1
I have one and LOVE it!!,5
I love these combs! I have medium length fine hair cut in layers and I have found multiple ways to put my hair up with these and keep all my hair in place even while I’m gardening!,5
"It's easy to use and for quick application. Doesn't take lot of time and a very little amount is enough and better with cotton.<br />It does have a little bit strong odor. Would recommend using it outdoors.<br /><br />Update: After first use, it is not working as expected. It is not effective anymore.",2
"I have a lot of problems with callousing of my feet so as I get older I'm more concerned about foot care.  The idea of these is great, however they are very cold and do not get up and walk even a short distance in them.  Your feet slide in them making them extremely dangerous for older persons.  They really aren't worth the money.",2
Very nice and soft.,5
Would normally rate this product 5 stars......I love it!  But it did not arrive.  Instead I received my full order of this product WITH CONDITIONER.  Leaves a sticky residue on my hair.,1
"Purchased for a lining when in a hard plastic hand brace.  Works great.  Not super cheap.  They hold up for one washing, but shrink.",5
good price,4
A little pricey but it smells great and feels great on your body,5
"It has smooth and cool  rolling, also I feel comfortable and convenient on using it. I really like this product!",5
"Cheap looking product, I wouldn't buy it again.",3
"When hair needs a quick and refreshing blow dry, this is the tool to have!  Throw away the water spray bottles purchased at various retailers that send streaks of water down your neck, back and shoulders.  This bottle emits the finest mist, just enough to allow you to refresh your style.  Learned about it at my last salon visit and immediately when home and purchased.  The size is stylish, comfortable to use and is available in both black or white.",5
It did last. The brush made it a little heavier than I would have liked. And because I’m Asian I would’ve liked a darker color. This was more of a ashy brown.,2
It is a fun product but it is closer to a light gray than white...,3
feels good on the scalp. a good sturdy well made brush. I had to return one from another company due to the bristle all falling out the first time you tried to use it. this one is worth the money.,5
My local place to buy was out of stock and I picked this up.  Worked great for what I needed which was DIY eliquid.,5
"The color is supposed to mix in to the balm product, but it has stopped doing so after a few uses.",3
"I didn’t expect this to be great for the price I paid, but it works as well as my more expensive one.",5
I use sticky tack to attach my press on nails to this gizmo in order to paint them before applying. Love not having to be careful not to mess up my nail polish.,5
"This hair looked really good for about 2 or 3 days, then it turned into a matted mess. It tangled so bad that I ended up just straightening out. Even then it was difficult to keep it from tangling. I had to take it out after 3 weeks because it looked so bad. Buyer beware...You get what you pay for and this was not a good deal.",2
One of the side plate keeps falling off. Mash up quick,2
Great working machine for my friend.,5
"I have purchased several sets of these brushes over the years but, after my most recent purchase, I will not buy again.  These brushes used to be a good quality, but I cannot say that any longer.  The brush fiber is now some sort of plastic composition that does not pick up and hold powder, blush, eye shadow, etc. well at all.  The handles have gotten shorter and the brushes have been reshaped.  Sorry to see these go this way.  They used to be amazing.",1
It's pretty nice considering how cheap it was.,4
Bought it for my Girlfriend who loves butterflies,5
Daughters boyfriend loved it,5
Love!  Smells awesome.  I do not have to use conditioner.,5
the style of hair clip stands out and the coloring is great,5
beautiful colors and not too heavy,5
"My second bottle, very happy with the product. Not as long lasting as drysol, but also not as harsh with less burn and less dry skin. When you use this product use it as directed and be prepared to use lotion where ever you use it on you body the next morning after you wash it of.<br /><br />The first part of my body that sweats long before I'm actually hot is also the most visible, my forehead. Its embarrassing and it also happens to be the part of my body that sweats the most when I am actually hot, to the point of wiping my forehead results in sweat flinging of my hand. With this spray I feel confident going into public on hot days knowing I wont be embarrassed.<br /><br />This spray is also very effective at controlling foot odor, %90 of foot odor is caused by your feet sweating.",5
"I am enjoying the other overpriced but good-smelling Agree products, but, this is just garbage. It's hard. It is like a wax candle or hard Crayon. It is worthless. There is nothing that can be done to it or with it to make it spread on ANYTHING, nevermind your delicate armpit area. I'm a moron to have bought it. They have some nerve making it. Do yourself a favor. Do not buy this. It's rubbish. I would like to give it negative stars. This is an un-star product. It's not even a product. I don't what it is. It's trash. That's what it is. This whatever it is makes me mad.",1
No. Returned.,1
These are not lasting nearly as long as other brands I’ve used. Seriously have a chip two days in. Usually my nails just grow out or after 2-3 weeks I’m ready for a change. Won’t buy this brand again.,2
"I learned about this from my shoemaker. He recommended it to protect my shoes from water, dirt and stains. It’s very flexible and light. You can tell that it’s there when dribbling water on the shoe...it rolls right off!",5
"I highly recommend these Makeup remover cloths they are amazing. No solution needed just wet the cloth in warm water and gently wipe your face and eyes, MAGIC your makeup is removed,  just rinse cloth with warm water and hang to dry.  I am so in love with these cloths..",5
Fabulous for price<br />Didnt match but I loved it,5
"Smells like something a barber would use. Just a good, clean scent to use daily. Longevity wise, it will last about 4-5 hours on skin and about 6-8 hours in clothes. If you sweat a great deal, maybe try another product.",5
This is a great idea but the tips tend to keep falling off. I had to use some pliers and tighten the top of the area that holds them.,3
I have never used a product like this before and am still working to perfect it but in the mean while I am having fun playing with it.  Easy to apply and last all day.  I did receive this with a promotional discount to give a review.  Once I get it down (I am not great at applying makeup) I will be placing an order for more.,5
"Very good packaging, shipping & smell like I like it to. Thanks",5
"This has saved me money in the long run. Since this pandemic, no pedicures for me. I use this after soaking my feet. My feet are soft and free of calluses. Doesn’t replace my massages on my feet but keeps calluses at bay.",5
Light nice smell. Better than the perfume,5
"A great night cream. Filled with high end herbal and natural ingredients found in department<br />Store brands at a fraction of the price. Has an interesting smell, kinda<br />Minty, but what it does for your skin is well worth it. My only skin care<br />Product of choice now .",5
I've been using this cream during my pregnancy. Started at 12 weeks and I'm now 27 weeks and no sign of stretch marks. The cream has a nice fragrance and is thick so it goes on nice and feels like it really keeps my skin moisturized. I'll be using this cream for the rest of my pregnancy.,5
I loved this Italian look and colors of this bottle in my kitchen. The soap smells nice too.,5
I love these wipes! They're impressively strong and have a great scent for the price. Mind you paying the amount Amazon is trying to charge is the worst idea you could have. I buy these at my local Dollar Tree for a whopping $1.  I recommend you visit your local dollar store to see what they have available.,5
"This is my first time using this brand after using tons of others like it. This is by far the best one! The color is amazing and pigmented (Without staining everything in sight)! The smell is nice and not over powering like others, but most importantly the dye actually conditions your hair! Really, it conditions it! I bleached my hair before coloring (wasn’t needed though) and it left my ends very dry, after using this dye they felt very hydrated without being weighed down. I would absolutely recommend this brand to everyone.",5
"I bought this just for fun, super cute!!",5
This holds a good amount of hair and stays well in my fine hair. It is pretty but not as nice as the more expensive one I bought for my daughter from Emi Jay.,4
Best tweezers ever!,5
The color is good but the foundation is not lasting long.,3
great product,5
These are the cutest barrettes - the same old 'clips' from yesteryear delightfully covered in felt.  Perfect for my granddaughter and her dolly!  I did read one review that said these look home-made.  They surely do and that is a big part of their charm.  These came nicely packaged in a pink organza bag inside of a windowed box.  They even included a ribbon to hang the barrettes on the wall.  Very nicely done Belle Beau!!,5
"These work as frames under a cloth mask. Alone, they are not quite long enough to cover from chin over nose. They're best for letting another person read my lips.",4
So much nicer to use than pins.No dropping and frantically searching for them for fear that the cat or dog will swallow one.No pin holes in delicate fabric.Highly recommend.,5
Not hard enough,1
XOXOXOXOXO!!!!!!,5
XOXOXOXOXO!!!!,5
"One out four came broken<br />Then during normal usage, another one broke. The rest of 2 hasn’t been used yet.<br />It also does not hold thick hair in place. The color is nice, but other than that I can’t think of anything better to say about it.",1
Very pretty and looked like expensive manicure but hard to trim,4
If you need it super clean this is the stuff,5
These are gorgeous! Beyond my expectations and I love them!,5
Guess I didn't read this well enough because it's bigger than I wanted. But it did arrive on time.,3
I received this Juve lip balm in my Ipsy bag.  And I absolutely fell in love with this! It's the best lip balm I've ever used.....and I try alot.  It gives the perfect amount of moisture to rehydrate your lips. And best of all it's not at all waxy!...which I can't stand.  I can see why there is a limited amount in stock...so order yours now.,5
"This is the best bath brush I ever owned. I've tried a few others but honestly everything about this one is exactly as the description states. The bristles are soft to your skin, not like others that can be harsh. The flip side is a massage and it does the job just fine. I'm very picky with what I buy, you won't be disappointed.",1
I bought these thinking they would come in a whole package..  but instead they were individually boxed ... So since my sister-in-law's love wine ... I gave them each a bottle...lol they loved it .. super cuuuute,5
These are the best,5
"I love this soap. I keeps for a long while and doesn’t melt like other soaps can do. And it suds well too. The fragrance is terrific, so lovely that it’s stays with me the whole day.",5
Did not like this at all,1
"I have the kind of skin that need to be exfoliated frequently, but I also have sensitive skin. These nicely fit the bill.<br /><br />You can use them in any shape (balled up, folded, spread out, etc) and they are effective. You do have to use a bit more soap than you would with a shower poof, but really a negligible amount. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin in need of a physical exfoliant.<br /><br />I would say this are also mobility-friendly--the length of the wash cloth would definitely work for people unable to bend over or lift their legs up.<br /><br />10/10",5
Had to have a comb attachment and this is the best. Fits my Elchim dryer perfectly.  Worth the cost.,5
This works wonderfully.  But use caution.  Will cut into flesh if you’re not careful.,5
As advertised<br />Great to use with my toner wipes,5
You can use these rounds for your face for cleansing and you can use them for around your ears and behind your ears for cleansing. I also use them with witch hazel for hemorrhoids very much cheaper than using tucks Pads which can be quite costly. You also can use them for taking off nail polish.,5
"Exact product as described online, work's great.",5
Description said can use in shower to keep water out of ears ....Not! They just rest on the tops of the ear...water pressure just knocks them off. Probably work pretty good for hair coloring....but not what I need.,2
It works,5
"I love, love, love the smell of this soap. It’s the best way to wake up in the morning. I have extremely sensitive skin and it’s never caused irritation like other soaps.",5
"Ok these pictures are terrible but it really is stunning, especially in natural light. My only complaint is that the already tiny pot is barely half filled, which I really didnt appreciate for $20. I recommend not completely curing the gel top coat (just leaving off a few seconds) so there's just tge slightest tack for the pigment to adhere to for best coverage (I used onedor no wipe gel top coat btw)",3
This has been around a long time and it is still an all around great product. Highly recommend.,5
"This product is not very good. As you spin the brush to begin drying it, it gets loose from the handle and falls right back into the water so it’s pointless. The spinner is not very strong and won’t really spin in the water. Would not recommend this one.",1
I have been using the Riiviva acne scarring system on my boyfriend for approx 6 months.  He has severe &#34;ice pick&#34; or really deep acne scars.  We've seen some improvement but it's been a slow process.  I would probably still buy this again but wish we would have seen more progress so far.,3
"I’m passionate about painting and always get confused to keep organized my colors while painting. This compact and extremely durable storage drawer is just amazing; it smartly helps me organize my painting color in the sequence so that I can find them easily. I also love the quality of the trolley that not only helps me keep my painting colors organized but also so many other accessories like makeup, skincare, and manicure & pedicure products.",5
"I can use this hair trimmer from Wtong for cutting hair of my beard, nose, eyebrows and sideburns. Easy to use, comfortable, portable, durable and good battery life make it ideal product for me. I am happy and satisfied with its purchase.",5
great product,5
Great cream. Works well. Works fast.,5
Great bath bombs. Nice smell and good quality,5
"We love coffee in our house so when I was presented with the opportunity to try these coffee drop candies in a tin I couldn’t pass them up. You get 3 cute little tins full of the candies and each had a freshness seal around them. The tin was easy to open, there were no sugar pieces from the coating that fell out, and each tin had 21 pieces in them. I found the size of the coffee drops to be quite adequate, not too small and not too big. I saw where a couple people thought they were huge but they’re about the size of a jelly bean but not as fat. They have a smooth coffee flavor with some sugar added in to make them the perfect little sweet. I found them to be very tasty and enjoyable. One candy at a time is plenty for a treat. They arrived in a cute black box that makes them perfect for gift giving and the tins are the perfect size to put in your purse, pocket, desk drawer, end table or pretty much anywhere else that you want to tuck away some coffee sweetness. We thought these were so good that we’re going to try one of Cavendish & Harvey’s variety packs next.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. However, that doesn't mean that I just automatically gave it a high rating and made up a review. All statements made are based upon my experience with the product as I always use each product for a period of time prior to leaving my comments in order to assist future purchasers.",5
"[[VIDEOID:1cefed5edab79f1f258b4d6bf402966e]] I bought this for my daughter to use.  My wife really likes it too.  It will allows them both to curl their hair on a single charge.  My daughter really likes that it's cordless, because it lets her curl her hair on the ride to school.  It helps on those days where we're running late.  It's small size will also be nice for travel.  She uses it several times a week and it has held up very well.",5
"The ear things are fairly useless. Honestly, just put some vaseline on your ears beforehand. Would be a better value with hair clips.",4
I use this to help take the edge of headaches and migraines. The smell is awesome.,5
This is my second order.  It cleanses my skin and leaves it leaves it moisturized.,5
Exactly what I was looking for!,5
Love the color. It tangled a little. Worked better for me when I cut the hair in half before braiding.,4
love the quality.,5
Girls loved them!,5
Used it or years and it works great. Hard to find in my town.,5
"Okay I’ll give pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />1. You can control the temperature very well<br />2. It heats up fast<br />3. The barrel shape makes it easy to curl even curls<br />4. Packaging was good<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The placement of the buttons are in the way of how to grab the device, so when you are using it you easily turn it off in the middle of doing your hair. The buttons are so slight that you don’t even know you’ve turned it off or changed the temperature. Very annoying.<br />2. The iron pulls on my hair, I don’t have damaged hair so it’s not because of that. My other iron doesn’t pull on it and I think I may go back to my old iron soon because of this problem.<br />3. And this isn’t a big deal, but the hair clips that come with it are terrible and useless. Very cheap and don’t hold the hair very well at all. So don’t count on using them is what I am saying lol!",3
Razor blades are ridiculously expensive.  These are great - long lasting - good value.,5
"M niece loves these!  I used to paint her nails, but now that she has these to put on herself, she has no patience for wet nail polish LOL! Easy for her to use, and reusable too! Love that they are stick-on instead of using glue. Even though they aren't long lasting, they last through her tea time, and that makes her happy.",5
"A good product, but irritating when you're new at using gel products, and they don't come with any instructions.",5
This polish is great. It comes on just as it shows in the pictures. Add more coats for a deeper color.,5
I have small areas of problem hair that get in my face. This was the perfect solution to hold back unruly bits of hair without having to use large bulky clips or hairpins. These are durable and won't break like plastic combs. They are very convenient and affordable. It's taken me a long time to find something I like this much.,5
Cabello,5
I like the concept. My hair is a bit too long to wrap up comfortably - waist length. Big complaint is the wire inside the fabric broke with just a few uses.,3
Received a color set different from the one I had ordered. However it did come all in one piece and the colors go on well.,3
"I was quite skeptical about a shampoo bar. Would it lather? Would it leave my hair smooth and shiny? We were trying different brands for an upcoming trip and I am now a shampoo bar convert! It is as good or better than shampoo in a bottle and for travel, there is no question it is the best choice. We bought two different bars of Garnier. The scent was lovely, and the lather exceeded my expectations. My husband said he rather use a shampoo bar from now on. The only thing was the length of time it lasts. It is supposed to last a lot longer than it actually does. For a trip it would be great for a week. If two people are using it, that would be all it would last. We are now into week two of just my husband using it and it is just pieces. Would I buy it again for a trip? Yes. Would I use it for everyday? No because it doesn't last long enough for the price.",4
"graat holder for your round plates.  looks nice too.  will only hold round plates, this is the only negative thing",4
"Its not unlike any run of the mill lipstick.  Its just lipstick, not a lip “tint which should go on sheer with a hint of color.  Based on all the wonderful reviews I ordered  3 colors and don’t like any of them....oh well...lesson learned.",1
"This is pretty much false advertising. Obviously I’m not going to return cotton balls, but be aware that these are absolutely NOT larger than regular sized cotton balls. Won’t be purchasing these again.",2
"Sort of cheaply made, but really pretty. It just doesn’t fit much hair in it.",4
"Omg, I LOVE this product! It’s the best thing ever! I have wavy hair with lots of cowlicks in strange places. Straitening irons, even the best of them, are tedious, but THIS is amazing. If you can, air dry your hair and simply brush with this for a gorgeous hair do that looks like you’ve had a professional blow out! This pays for itself in no time!",5
"I have never gone wrong with their products and this is no exception. I always have to ask myself if I'm falling for their packaging, but the products win every time. Love this stuff!",5
I love these and they are A favorite for my granddaughter! Easy to apply. I also could easily put a clear coat over the top.,5
I wanted to like this brush. It feels good going through my hair but I have to go over it to get everything other than the top layer. It would probably be nice with really fine hair or for toddlers.,3
Small but we made it work!my daughter was Sophia from the golden girls for Halloween,5
Love it. Hate the price!,5
"Coverage is so so...but consider SPF 50, it may be good in summer time.",3
"I saw a japanese tiktoker using this so I decided to try it. I wear eye contact most of the time and also my eyes get dry a lot, but this product really helped me keep my eyes clean and hydrated! I use it right after I remove my makeup and it also helps me get rid of the residue.",5
Great glasses for pressed juice,5
"I use this as a facial moisturizer and it works better than any other JB product I have bought for this purpose.<br /><br />At first it seems like you are going to end up with extremely oily skin, but it absorbs within a couple minutes and does a great job.",5
"Colors are lovely, would have preferred this with accompanying brush.",4
Love this.  Worked great!,5
This is a wonderful product. My hands are so soft. I highly recommend.,5
I love this stuff.  Perfect scent-  light!  Will buy more,5
"Meh. They're ok, but not great. I wish they were  larger (it says large but I would consider these small to medium) so I could use one instead of two. And they're pretty cheap quality. They grip well, but I have no faith that they will last.",2
"I love this gel. I have a lot of very curly, baby fine hair and I've been using it for years. It weighs my hair down enough that it's not frizzy without being crispy crunchy! I used to use their version of PM Super Clean Styling Gel, but I actually like this more!",4
"This product does not irritate my eyes...which is good. It does not have a very strong hold, though.",5
Fluffy Wispy lashes. False lashes.,5
This product works surprisingly well. The chestnut is a good natural color (my hair is brownish black. It was easy to apply and didn’t smear. The extra items that come in the kit are nice. Great product for the price.,5
I like the shampoo and the conditioner it made my hair feel soft and bouncy.,5
Takes the tangles out -F-A-S-T-.<br />Took less than 3 minutes with this brush.<br />It used to take at least 15 minutes and I'd have to rip and tear my hair out.<br />Get this!  You won't regret it.,5
"I use a LOT of sheet masks.  It's a shame Spa Life made such a great serum and then added it to an AWFUL sheet!<br />Firstly, the sheets are too small.  If your face is the size of an 8 year old's, they'll work fine;  otherwise, forget it!<br />And because the sheets are the texture of cardboard, you cannot STRETCH them out over your face, as you should be able to do.

"Flat iron has a ""high tech"" LCD screen with a touch panel.<br />I've had this flat iron for over a month and still can't operate the touch screen correctly without looking at the directions.<br />One day, I was in a hurry and couldn't FIND the directions.  I had just washed my hair and couldn't get the iron on the setting I needed.  So, I had to leave the house without properly doing my hair.<br />THAT was real annoying.<br />So ... minus one star because the touch panel sux.<br /><br />=====================<br />UPDATE:  August 20, 2019<br />DOWNGRADE from 4-stars to 3-stars.<br />I really HATE the touch panel.

"This is probably one of the best, if not, THE BEST conditioner I've ever used in my life.<br />It made my hair FEEL like no other conditioner has ever made my hair feel.  Ever!  This stuff is made in Germany, for whatever that's worth.  My conditioner came in a nice box with NO insert.  So don't expect to get any ""promo"" info or instructions. The box has 5 words: ""rinse after 5-10 minutes.""  I left the product in my hair for 20 minutes 'cause I didn't SEE the instructions until later (in tiny print).<br />Just use it and see and FEEL the difference in your hair.  You will NOT NEED a detangler either.  Hair comes out smooth as silk.<br />Good stuff!",5
I used almost every brands but this one is the best.  I've been using Helen Of Troy curling iron for years because its last long time.  I usually on for over 30 minutes still it won't burn out quickly like other brands. Also temprature is just right for my fine hair. Just spring gets worn out after 2-3 years everyday using so I usually purchase extra spring for just in case.  Order paper for spring is in a box.,5
I like the idea of these and I could function slightly better versus wearing the clip on kind but my fingers barely fit. They are very snug to get on. Most of the acetone squeezes out of the cotton ball and drips down my hand. I use 1/2 of a small cotton ball. If they were a tad bigger I think they would be better. I think I have average size fingers for a woman. Wear a size 6 wedding ring.,3
The other reviews must be fake. This thing is a pos. It won't remove any hair no matter the size or which direction you go. Save your money. If I could rate it under 1 star I would have.,1
"When I received this product I immediately opened the package to read the directions as I had planned on using it the next morning after I had washed my hair. I have to agree with other reviewers in that the instructions and English was an atrocious and I assumed the product would be as well. After all, a person would think that with such carelessness in the description of the product, that the product itself would be inferior. Oh, how wrong I was! I have highlighted hair that has also been damaged by a flat iron. I have been wanting to grow my hair out some but with the damage I was doing to my hair, each time I went for a “trim”, my hair dresser would have to cut off too much damaged ends. So, I quit using a flat iron and started using better products on my hair. When I got the opportunity to review this item, I was excited to give it a try and see if it would help. What I found was simply amazing. My hair now feels thick and bouncy and I can’t believe how much easier it is to style. My hair is very fine so the additions of hair products usually just weighs my hair down, but this product does not. I can’t wait until my next trim with my hair dresser and see if she notices a difference…I certainly did. I did receive this item at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and I am grateful for that opportunity.",5
"I have been wanting a case like this for a very long time and when I got the opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I jumped at the chance and I am so glad that I did. This pink train case is all and more than I expected and I am beyond thrilled to own this now. In the past I have thrown all my makeup in a zippered travel case and then had to try and sift through the items inside to locate what I was looking for. Sometimes I would just dump the contents out because it was such a struggle. With this pink beauty, all my items can be nicely organized and will stay right when I put them. When closed up, nothing is going to move around and when opened up, everything is right within easy reach and easy to find. This has a large mirror which was a great surprise to me that sits at a perfect height and angle when putting on my makeup. I have struggled for some time to find a way to use a hand held make up mirror while trying to put on my makeup while traveling.  I also really appreciated that the top two sections have plastic on the bottom of the tray. We all know that makeup can get messy if spilled and this will allow for easy clean-up if such a thing should ever happen. The case itself is a nice shade of pink and the quality of workmanship is awesome. I could tell by just picking the case up how strong and sturdy that it was. I am so excited to have this case and I am extremely grateful that I was given the opportunity to purchase this at a discount for an honest, unbiased review.",5
These are much nicer than I expected. They stay nicely in my hair and the colors are vibrant. It was work waiting a little longer to receive these. My only complaint is that two of the pieces are very similar in color.,5
"With this being the 3rd pack that I have purchased; from 3 different companies, this is the worse.  Not only were a few items defective, the entire package was dirty.  I found hair, bits of paper and dirt on a few of f the rollers.  8/9 items show above have pin prick size holes at the top.  Every time the item is used the hole is stretched and the hole is enlarged.  The items are great, which is why I have purchased more than one, but this company is not the one for my family and I.",1
It is very easy to use.,4
"looks like the original ones but the elastic is way too short, not much stretch and thin .",2
"Works on my waist-long hair, which is thick but fine and soft.  This gets the snarls out but doesn't break my hair as much as other combs.",5
"My hairdresser uses this, so I purchased it for home use. Gives my fine, thin hair the body I want.",5
great smelling and does the job on tack,5
Great for taming frizzy curly hair. Smells great.,5
"I live in L.A. and we have sun 365 days of the year. Sunscreen is an absolute must if you care at aIl about your face and looking as young as you can for a long as you can. I discovered Hang Ten about 3 years ago and I've used nothing but Hang Ten ever since. It's lightweight, doesn't make me sweat, doesn't feel like a mask and doesn't give off a white glow in pics. It's not always easy to find in stores, but Amazon always has it which makes me super happy.",5
"These disposable hair nets have a great technology and have made working with bath and body products much easier.  Just do not yank on them too much while tucking in stray hairs, or you may tear the net too loose and need to put a new one on.  It's really very easy to get the hang of however.",5
"Great product, they fit perfect on my eyes.",5
I love your product line - I definitely notice a difference in my skins texture - not as dried out as before began using.  I'm also using the eye serum which has tamed the circles and bags under my eyes.  Thank you!!!!,5
The best for my hair!,5
"After 4 manicures all supplies are paid for! This light works great, completely adequate for home use. Don't forget to vigorously wipe down your fresh nails with rubbing alcohol soaked cotton to get off the sticky coating after your nails are cured!",5
Just didn't work!!,2
"My wife wore this to a formal Trafalgar Anniversary dinner and was the ""belle of the ball.""",5
Easy to use with no aerosol  issues as I have asthma.  Travels well in the suitcase.,5
Ordered the mini kit to try the product. Liked the way it went on nails. Did not last two weeks but I got at least one week. The one thing I think the manufacturer should do is double the amount of the actual colored polish in the kit because you use two coats for each manicure. The kit is fairly expensive and I probably got 4 or 5 manicures. Now I have no color left but have the remaining mini bottles of base and top coats.,4
"I keep buying DOP egg shampoo for its great cozy scent (think a soapy whiff through an old-fashioned laundry window on a rainy day). The scent is not sweet, just reminds me of that of a brown laundry bar soap from the old country. It has the usual, not-so-great ingredients in its cosmetic composition, but stays fairly gentle on my very fine hair. It adds some volume, too. I like the bottle design, especially the corner dispenser.",5
"Love the aroma of this soap, smells wonderful of sweet herbs found in nature. priced more than other body soaps from Agafia, but the container is larger. This product is NOT SLS-free, so be aware.",5
"I love the Oster trimmers and I use them daily.  I have two Oster trimmers and both cords needed to be replaced.  I have saved alot by changing the cords myself.  The cords are very easy to change, Thanks",5
Doesn't stink like other brands and holds my hair on place without looking sticky.,5
good nail care system,5
"It doesn’t have the “weight” that I am used to with pocket combs, and the safety is a bit flimsy. This is still a good product and does what it is supposed to.",4
Excellent between shave razor maintenance product.  Truly does help keep blades sharp longer.  Has a nice smell too.  Highly recommended.,5
Puro alcohol,2
"I was actually going to return this the minute it got delivered because of some of the reviews… but since I got the notification that I could keep the product, I decided to try it out.<br />And to my surprise it really is a great product. I don’t know if this photo will do it justice. I tried getting as close as possible to show how it looks.<br />I did light strokes and love the way they came out.<br />This is the brunette color.<br />And for my first time doing this I think this is amazing.<br /><br />Also, please note that I do not have anything else on or around my eyes. I applied this bare face.",4
I needed more of an arch support,5
I bought this maybe a year ago and returned 2 of the 3 packs. Best decision ever to keep 1 pack. I get so many compliments on the colour (which I initially thought was too bright). Only downside is it feels weird and knots up so much. I would actually buy this again.,3
"This cream is wonderful. The awesome scent is a big favorite of mine. It's perfect  .  Almost. while the pricing is affordable for me, but it's small small tube. I went thru one and in less than a month, maybe, I had to reorder.<br />Bottom line is I'm not using it as much as I would like. No LOVE to, but I can't afford to use it regularly. Sad 4 me.<br />UPDATE: This went to a very reasonable price of $7.50 and wish I had bought a few extra!  because as it the case in EVERYTHING lately, that I purchase, the product either is NOT available or the Price is INCREASED.  almost every time... Amazon!!  I guess you may not control these things - such as availability and pricing, but I will lease this message for YOU and for the vendor because when this happens I will NOT be a return customer.  This is so discouraging, and it's like I am sorry but if you want return customers then stick to what the product is worth.  it's a very very tiny tube! so at seven dollars, okay, but now immediately you increase by two dollars, I just WILL NOT buy from you.<br />please at least create a system for return purchasers... I just bought this month, just received last week and you have UPPed the price by $2!  geesh!!! plus it says that I purchased three times including this one last week.",5
It is ice; but it is a darker red than pictured and not as glittery as described.,2
"This cream is amazing if you have dry skin. Apply right after shower and skin will absorb in less than 5 mins., you won't feel the after application stickiness. However, BJs has the 19oz bottle with pump for $15 and they often have coupons. The 3 stars is because of the price on this listing not the product.",3
Excellent product it the sprayer of the bottle is terrible.just pour it in your hands and apply it that way,5
"Ive gotten two of these now,and they dont last even a month.They are WONDERFUL! But should last longer...",3
I really like this mask. It makes my face feel really soft and does not make me break out. And it smells delicious.,5
"These rub my eyes in the bad way. They're really rough, and really not that thick. I think you get what you pay for in terms of these. Obviously they still do their job, but I really wish they were softer because I feel like I'm probably getting scratches on my skin even with it soaking wet.",3
I put it on using a stencil and liked the result. My hair is red brown. Sadly it didn't stay on at all. Maybe if I'd used an eyeshadow primer or other stick-em helper.,3
I have seen these used at my Dentist office on their mouthwash bottles. I asked where to get them no-one could tell me. So very happy I found them on Amazon. Works great.,5
Love! The perfect size for a 2year old.,5
I like this oil as it has a nice  consistency and aroma.  Have been using it mixed with some olive oil for bug bites & rashes.  It's working great for that.,5
Great cleanser,5
I love this tanning oil - it does not stay oily on your skin but makes your skin soft and has a nice scent. I used while on a cruise in the Caribbean and although it had only a SPF6 rating I did not get a sunburn!,5
"Works great, highly recommend",5
Light already not working. No light bulb to replace.  Totally useless for me without the light. Lasted 3 months. Soo disappointed. Paid what I consider a lot of money for inferior product.,1
Poisonous Garbage,1
Much cheaper elsewhere. I just didn't have time to research best price so I let myself get ripped off. The product is great as always. The price was insanely high comparatively. Again however. The product is as always great. Been using it for years..,2
Seemed to behave more like a concealer than a color corrector and to cake a bit after it dried.,2
"I am a heavy iced tea drinker & have stains on my teeth as a result. I ordered these individual toothpastes which are grittier than usual & it has worked!! My teeth are white again!! Great vendor, fast shipping, fair price. A+++++",5
I’ve tried a ton of magnetic lashes and so far these are my favorite. The lashes are nice and thick but not too long making them a perfect day lash. The magnets attached to the band stayed on even after several rough attempts to align them properly (user error). I will definitely be buying another pair as I can tell that I will be getting a lot more use from this set than some of my $30+ dollar sets. I highly recommend!,5
"I love these lashes, they are absolutely beautiful! I had to do a little trimming so that they complimented the smaller frame of my face but they look so full and lovely. I’ll definitely be purchasing again for special occasions.",5
"Ok so I love falsies and have spent hundreds of dollars on those celebrity lashes we all know but can rarely afford but they are a pain in the a** to put on. These lashes are so freakin easy and if I don’t get them on perfect the first time it’s ok because I can just try again. I like the three different sizes that come in the kit because I like shorter thicker lashes for every day and long lashes for special events and pictures. It took me less than 5 minutes to completely apply these. Make sure you apply the liner, let it set 15 to 20 seconds and then reapply. I let my lines dry for a whole minute before putting the lashes on so that there is no chance of getting goop on my lashes. All in all I will be purchasing these on a regular basis for sure!",5
My boss took in a group of feral cats that gave both me and my charges scabies. I tried ivermectin and it failed but was worried about using potentially harmful medication and creams to treat the children so after many hours of research I was pleased to stumble across this much safer ointment. I used this along with sulfur soap and it obliterated my &#34;infestation&#34; and the kiddo's!,5
This is a very very high quality product. It is loaded with botanical extracts. I just started using it and I can tell that it is very good for my skin.,5
"I  can actually breath from inside my mask. The purpose served perfectly however the clips are horrible. I doesn’t stay on a regular surgical mask, hospital issued mask. Every time i take my mask off, this braces kept falling.",3
"Rarely use because I have designated brushes for each color eyeshadow. BUT, when I have used it - it works.<br />As I mentioned, it is pretty and pink and looks nice in my bathroom. (Don't Judge!)",5
They really help to remove dead skin. I no longer have to scratch my back and other parts of my body due to the dry weather.,4
This wig is soft but is extremely short & is no where near the right length. Highly disappointed in this wig.,1
Thia bottle is extremely small for the price. I imagined it would be of a slightly larger size. It doesn't hold much water at all.,1
"I bought this wanting to use it when I washed my hair, but it doesn't work on wet hair. The silicone...spikes?...they're not bristles, so I'm not sure what to call them...don't glide through wet hair. The hair sticks to them and they just pull your hair.<br />Glad I'm only out $4...",2
"I love this. Also gave  one to each daughter as a stocking stuffer and they love them too. It’s so long that you can wash your whole back. Love the perfect level of friction. Great exfoliation. The ones we got were from Japan, not China.",5
Great deal but bands are small - probably best for kids,3
Very happy with these so far. Nice quality. I use my beauty blender cleanser to clean these. I haven’t machine washed yet. Would recommend.,5
Great Product,5
"Neon Paradise: In order to make this look the way it should, you have to apply 2 or 3 coats or use a solid polish under it.  I used and OPI lime green polish under it which helped.  I do like the neon green of it.  It's just way too thin.",2
These straight edge clippers are so much better than curved ones.  This one is very sharp and easy to use.,5
My dentist provided this brush to me and it's the best one he ever provided.  The long brushes at the tip are perfect for getting behind molars and the brush is very gentle.,5
I only took this product out of the package long enough to discover that it was very stiff and rough and not at all what I was looking for.<br /><br />I returned them for a much better product.,1
I bought this as a gift. I thought it was pricey but it was a nice gift.,5
Great for the lazy like me. Very refreshing.,5
This makes cleaning brushes so much easier.  No need to buy a more expensive one.  This was the cheapest one I saw and it came with a small one to hold in your hand and a little beauty sponge.  Great deal!,5
Great pencil at a great price. Very smooth natural look.,5
great product; love it for my daughter,5
I love these! I think they work better than the actual beauty blender I have. I don't even use that anymore since I bought these,5
Definitely not etched deep enough. It's basically a plate with images placed on and not etched on. It feels completely smooth to touch. Very disappointed considering I bought it as a birthday gift for my mom.,1
Lesson learned with this product. Too many 5 star reviews (1000's) should have been a clue.  I really hoped for the best with this product.  I have dry chemically processed hair that looks & feels healthy IF I use quality products. Quality (ex: Aveda) means I have to spend a lot of $$$ & th emoney saved with this product wasn't worth it.  My first clue that something was amiss was the enormous amount of lathering and the excessive silky feel to the shampoo (synthetic silk?).  I had followed up with the argan oil deep conditioner.  After my hair dried it looked and felt like--STRAW.  Not a happy customer.,1
I love this hairspray but the 3 cans I received smell old and stale.  This hairspray usually smells delicious.  Date of can stamped 2015.  Could be old stock. Will just buy locally.,1
They are a little on the small side.  The fragrant of the soup is . so . . so. . .,3
"I applied this twice a day under one eye for my evaluation. I was skeptical, but that one eye appears improved over the other eye with respect to skin tightness and reduced wrinkles. The benefit remained after I paused usage for a few days. The coloration was not impacted. I am a guy and generally do not use products like this.",4
"An unremarkable conditioner. The name-brand conditioners work better and cost much less. This Foamiest product does nothing to thicken hair. It does not work well as a conditioner. None of the ingredients are associated with reducing hair loss. The three peptides in this product are<br />sh-Oligopeptide-1,<br />sh-Oligopeptide-2, and<br />sh-Polypeptide-3.<br />There are some peptides associated with hair health, such as GHK-Cu and TB-500, but this product does not contain those peptides. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that the ingredients in this product do anything for hair health. I searched online for any scientific studies and could not find anything, or even any theoretical benefits. I could also not find anything in the popular hair loss discussion forums. The manufacturer is making false and misleading claims to push their overpriced product. They are also making false claims about what caffeine does, such as saying that it suppresses DHT, which it does not do.",1
"I am surprised this product worked. It does what it claims to do. It gave me a realistic-looking tan and that tan withstood multiple showers and cleaning wipes. The tan looks like I spent the day in the sun, rather than dark brown or orange.<br /><br />The problem with a product like this is the color contrast with the places you do not apply this to, or if you miss a spot, or if you have thinning hair. It can go on blotchy if it is not applied evenly. Some parts of the body might become darker or not absorb this as well. Making it appear smooth is a challenge. Also, where do you stop applying this to your body? Wherever you stop there will be a contrast with the untanned skin. One particular problem is your hairline and scalp. I have thinning hair, so the contrast between a pale scalp and a tanned face looks odd. This is a challenging product to use and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are already used to using sunless tanners.<br /><br />It is not greasy, it did not stain, and it dried quickly. The ingredients seem healthy for the skin. There is no smell to the cream.",1
"I knew better than to buy these. I love the amount you get for the money so two stars, but they didnt do any thing for my hair. I have long thick wavy hair and wouldnt hold the curl.",2
First place ive seen these scents. Like them all. Not overly strong and my 11 year old loves them.,4
"Compared to my regular replacement heads, these heads feel much firmer and more stimulating to the gum.  They also snap more firmly to my brush than do my regular heads and run more quietly.<br /><br />If I had to choose between the two, I'd choose my regular head first.  Because, however, I've already bought these and they may have some beneficial effects the regular heads lack, I've chosen to alternate the heads.  I use one head to clean my teeth with baking soda, then floss, then use the other head to brush with toothpaste.<br /><br />I've now been using this head for two months.  It only took a couple of days to get used to the stiffness and I wouldn't even notice it if I wasn't alternating the heads.  I see no evidence, however, that it cleans any better.",4
Seems to be good,4
Nice product but a little too much glitter for me. Using during the summer months,5
I only received my bottle a week or two ago so it has not been long enough to see full results.  My initial impression:  this is one SMALL bottle!  The instructions were even smaller but its pretty straightforward.  There is no concern on off putting smells.  But caution is needed to put the serum on without getting it in the eye. Disclosure: I received the product at  discount for my review.,4
Don’t seal liquids well,5
"I prefer the plastic ones with solid heads for easy cleaning, but I like that this one is stainless steel and will last forever. It is small, though.",4
"I have one of these in each shower. The scrubber feels really nice on my scalp and helps the shampoo to lather well in my hard water. It is easy to hold and maneuver, and my scalp feels really clean. I can definitely scrub harder with this than I can with my arthritic fingers.",5
These are inexpensive but seem to be good quality. I keep one in my purse and one in each car for emergencies. They are a nice small size and store easily.,5
Best soap ever,5
Excellent,5
Not mirror effect....but cute colors for the price....came with little pink earrings I think my niece will like!,4
This headband is exactly what I need to dress up a summer floppy hat.,5
Lovely,5
Very nice mask and my skin feels hydrated after the mask. You don't really need lotion after. Smells really nice,5
Love this set! Such a great price for everything that is included! 😍 A+,5
These are very pretty and well made. They came in a plastic bag which was disappointing because the leaves are bent. And they don’t lay flat when you put them in your hair. That’s a little disappointing but I will keep them. I wear hair decoration all the time and I gave the flowers a 3 because of the packaging and the fact that they don't lay flat. The colors are good. Accurate per the description.,3
"Wish the ones I ordered yesterday were the same I ordered a few months ago.<br />The one on the right in the photo is the original one i ordered off this listing a couple of months ago. It is metal with a thinner top.<br />Thenone on the right is what I got. It's like plastic and thick at the top, which I cannot use for thinner nails.",1
I love these little pieces for my press on nails. The stand is my favorite but the stands break easily.,3
so easy to use between salon visits.,5
nice  and soft beautiful  hand band,5
all you need to know I love this wig .I ordered  (10) already  and will  order plenty more. beautiful  in all colors..stop wasting time and order  yours  today.,5
My hubby  love it and it keeps me from cleaning the floor afterwards. .. buy it!!,5
"I don't know if it's me but no matter what I did it looked like a wig.  Didn't like the color either, it's yellow.  I'm new to wigs so maybe don't know how to style them yet.  Need to get a better quality one.",2
These are just beautiful and for me they have lasted several day.  Expensive for 6 tho.,5
Greasy as heck.  Returned.,1
this took months to be delivered.  I have others from different co and this was no where close to being like them.  it has a cottony feel to it.  does not mold well to the head and the edges do not blend well with my hair.  it was cheap enough that it is not worth sending back.  the white color is a stark white.  I do not recommend except for fun,3
Looks great and mists perfectly.,5
"My wife introduced me to hyaluronic serums. This brand (Doctors Preferred) feels great.  I need just a few drops.  It penetrates quickly, without any sticky residue and I can use it morning and evening.<br /><br />No fragrance, no irritation and the prince point is perfect.<br /><br />Recommended.",5
"This is an excellent manicure kit.  Everything you need for a manicure or a pedicure.<br /><br />I really held off getting a new set and wound up with bald sponges and nail files that were sooo smoothed out they were useless.  FINALLY, I can file my nails again.<br /><br />This set contains everything you need sans clippers.<br /><br />Recommended.",5
Good product for my hands and feet after bathing and washing. Soft feel.,4
I love these!  I have very fine straight hair and those stretchy hairbands you find at drugstores just slip off.  These are adjustable and do not slip or slide off - regardless if my hair is down or in a pony tail.  I wear them to the gym and out running errands and haven't had any issues!,5
"I love this conditioner. Once I use up the other kinds I have, this will be the only conditioner I buy from now on.",5
I was disappointed in these are really small. They probably would be good for a child but not an adult.,2
"Great brush! So easy to clean, needed this my whole life! My cat (and small dog) love this brush. It works well and is super easy to clean.",5
"Great brush set...  My daughter had bought one of another set...that cost a lot more.. she was using mine instead.. so I ordered a set too..  I'm not one to put a lot of time into my make up application.. but,.. I do love how these brushes.. fit my hand and apply my makeup quickly and expertly.",5
"They were the easiest hair puns to use. I bought two types, these and rhinestone Bobby pin style.<br /><br />These by far slid right into place while the others were very beautiful they were hard to place in hair without flattening the area.<br />These are easy to bend in direction you might desire.<br />I’d say I would give 5 stars if it was brighter Glistening rhinestones. I was happy with the fast delivery!!  Thank you Covid wedding mother of the bride!!",4
"It curls my lashes, and generally works better than the manual ones. However, it only works as long as the batteries are full (in other words, it goes through batteries fast) - so 3 stars.",3
"I bought this to try it out and I am positively impressed with these skin care products. I usually struggle with breakouts and sensitive skin and have to be mindful about the products I use. I am happy to report, the Etude House Moistfull Collagen Skin Care Set has been kind to my skin. More specifically, after using it for about a week, I started to notice changes in my skin: my blemishes have cleared up, my pores are smaller, and my skin feels softer and more refreshed. With regard to the products themselves, they smell pleasantly, absorb well into the skin, and don't leave any oily or sticky residue behind. Unlike other products, very little of the products is needed to sufficiently cover the entire face.",5
"I was hoping to be able to take care of my own toe nails, but this won't keep the drill bit in so it's useless. I will be returning it.",1
My grand daughter these bows and the book<br />so proud of Gabby,5
The color is lovely the pink under tone is a nice touch. The lipstick takes a few seconds to warm on your lips to apply evenly but over its great!,5
"OMG, I love this thing! It's a shower back scratcher-scrubber-sponge thingamagiger all in one!!! I'm thinking I'm gonna have to get my fiance one, because he keeps trying to steal it. And it smells like guy body wash. Actually, I may buy a couple more just so I'll have an extra when this one needs replacing. Omg, I'm never going back to the poof thingies!",5
Not very easy to use and kept burning myself,1
Amazing deal! That is it’s an amazing deal when it’s available for $10.,5
At first I liked it. Then I started noticing a weird almost rash like bumps starting. Ive had ingrown hairs before and this was different.<br />I pulled my razor from this device to find the strips came off on the metal. Got a new razor and the bumbs stopped coming.<br />Could have been something else causing them but its a big coincidence.,1
Love this headband and especially that it is adjustable. I have a small head so most headbands are too big for me. It is very comfortable and I love the style. A bonus is that for every headband purchased one goes to a child in need. I will be buying more as Xmas gifts!,5
"This is the best one I tried on Amazon. I tried many brands, but this is the best one per unit. Very soft, (kinda thin), does not pill off. I'm going to stick around here :)",5
Great to find this product! woohoo!,5
"Smells nice...but very expensive. My bottle arrived with about 20% of the product “missing” due to leakage (plastic wrap was wet).  It has a very pleasant scent, but the price is really too high for the small amount. I wanted to try this out before deciding wether  to purchase a bigger bottle. The bigger bottle is a better value for the money, but the product did not make much of a difference in my hair and the smell disappeared right away.... so I will not repurchase.",3
"This is NOT a bad product, in fact it is quite nice. However my skin did not feel any different or cleaner than it does after I use my usual organic cleansers that costs half the price. I found it quite curious that the 4  5 Star reviews are written by people that only reviewed products by this company, seems a little fishy to me. Having said that, if money is no object, this is a nice cleanser, but there are others that do the job just as well and are also all natural that cost half the price.",3
Not a fan of the smell,4
"Saw rave reviews of this on buzzfeed, they didn't lie. This stuff is super cute on the outside (packaging) yet packs a punch on the inside. My outbreaks are gone. Just stick with it every night, or be a tired lazy gal like me and forget a few night in a row and regret ruining your progress lol.",5
"Love this. Sheer color is a little lost with the opaque shine, but it's still a nice product. Moisturizing, good flavor and better ingredients than most!",5
These are the worst! I have used a number of Nail Polish Strips from various sellers and companies and these have been by far the worst. You get what you pay for and they refuse to stick! DO NOT BUY,1
"Right now my entire upper floor smells like fresh cleaned linen and my daughter is cooing over her new Jolteon toy. I did a lot of research before buying because my kid has sensitive skin and accepts no imitations when it comes to her Pokemon. This bath bomb set did not disappoint!  They have a great fizz, amazing scent, leave the skin feeling soft, and include a recognizable Pokemon!",5
Love the three sets of lashes. Originally had a problem with the liner being dry but the company responded quickly and sent a replacement. The lashes look real and are very comfortable. They stayed on all day. I plan on getting more for Christmas gifts.,5
I don't believe there is much in it as it did not last no time and I only use it about 2 times a week. Other than that it did make my lashes more visible.,4
Love it!!!!!,5
I Love Mirenesse mascaras!  I have worn them for years and love that they make such a difference in the transformation of my eyes!  Easy to apply and remove.,5
Love this loofah. Perfect balance of softness and scrubbing power. I’m glad I had read about the dark spots inside being normal as there were indeed some  spots on the inside.<br />Very pleased with this product.,5
Really helps scrub makeup brushes clean. I love sigma brushes but this is clearly a better deal and really no different than their much more expensive version.,5
I don't have any scalp problems.  But I use because it leaves me hair soft and light controls frizz. Not greasy.,5
"I don't know about scalp treatment, but my hair is so soft and it controls frizz. Smells like bananas while using, but rinsed clean.",5
"These are very thin, so you need to be very careful peeling them off and using tweezers is best. In my photo you can see the edges a bit but that disappears with a top coat. This comes with three black and three white.",4
"Easy to peel off and apply. Stuck well, of course use a quality top coat to seal in for longevity. My only complaint is while a large variety, there are only a couple of each sticker. I would love to purchase multiples of specific sheets.",4
"I like that these are a nice thin fabric and still has vibrant color. I didn't have a problem with the button placement like some stated. Wore them for 12 hour shifts. My only problem is they are not non-slip. They didn't come off, but moved around enough that the hair tucked under around my temples and ears would bunch out. I have thin-ish shoulder length hair.",4
"The smell is really strong. Not at all subtle.  It reminds me of scented talcum powders my Grandma used to use, kind of a spicy floral smell.  I personally think it is too strong and would not want to go around smelling that way if I can help it. That said, it works well to decrease the appearance of oily roots and can extend your hair wash by a day for sure, if you can stand the smell.  I will keep it as a backup for when I run out of  the other lighter scented dry shampoos.",3
"I bought this to clean my dog’s teeth. I used on me first. It did not remove the minor plaque on me or the major plaque that my dog has. Don’t waste your money on it.,",1
"I love the imPRESS line!  I am terrible with my nails.  I bite, pick, and quite frankly just beat them up.  Nail polish helps me take better care once in awhile, but that only lasts a day or so.  I've done the acrylics and gels, but hate how they damage your actual nail, or have to keep going back to the salon.<br />I love how inexpensive these little guys are!  I don't feel bad about changing them out after awhile and trying a new set.  The adhesive glue on the back is flexible, but holds super well!!  I love how even once they are old, they don't just pop off!<br />I have pretty narrow nails, so I need to file down the sides on some of them before applying, but you definitely want them to fit right otherwise they won't stay on as long.  If they are too wide, the edge will left up eventually.  Otherwise, these will last two weeks easy!<br />I think they're adorable, and got major compliments on them.  People are always amazed when I tell them they're press-on.  :)",5
Recommended for dry eye problem but very soothing.<br />I heat 30 seconds in microwave and use 15 minutes during one massage chair cycle. I'm spoiled,5
Does it's job and manages to be cute in the process. Holding up well to my teens. Good value.,5
I just started using this oil and so far so good.  I am taking a harsh chemo drug right now and it's drying my skin out horribly.  I primrily use this on my face as I get a lot of dry spots during the day and it has helped considerably although I need to apply quite frequently.,5
"love it and have been wearing this scent for years, but it's hard to get out of the bottle when you're in the shower.",5
Love these. Super affordable.,5
Love these. Seem to be pretty sturdy.  I use them daily to clean my night guard. I was unable to pick the color.,5
I use this every day. It is soft and gentle. I love using it. Makes my hair feel great too.,5
"I wear this color all the time when I go to the nail shop. However, possibly my shipment may have been bad, but it’s extremely dull absolutely no shine, even with a top coat.",2
It is good for price,4
"Good variety and nice quality. I have no idea if they are painted with a safe lead free paint or not, but as long as they remain in her hair, and not in her mouth, I think they're good.  She likes them!",5
Great cream.,5
Works well but the smell of chlorine is very strong. I now prefer alcohol-based hand sanitizers.,3
The outside case breaks open (does not close properly) after only some use and the little scissor does not cut and the tweezers ends do not meet so not good for anything..,1
Durable and easy to store. I love how easily it folds. It’s perfect!,5
"Advertised for the mature women. This mature women wishes it wasn't so shinny.<br />After using it for a week,I found it to be a very inferior product. Would not recommend.",1
Love this product. Too bad they stopped making it.,5
"Does even out blemishes, has a dryness feeling",3
Birthday present for my niece and she loved them.,5
"Nice, kind of flimsy, but I hope that it serves it's purpose when I use it.  Will give a full comment in June 2017, when I use it.",3
Love this shower gel. Wish it was sold here in the US but luckily I can buy from Amazon. The smell is divine.,5
"I was able to wear my left hand for 3 weeks.  Amazing for press on nails.  I am right handed  and they only lasted a week.  They got very soft , but did stay on",4
I needed something to keep my mask off my mouth as I suffer from cold sores. This one works. Best of all it stays comfortably in place. I do find it gets a little warm thought because the silicone is a thicker grade. A small price to pay for its ease of use. I like how easy it cleans up too.,5
"My hair feels fuller and healthier with these. I'm a 57 year old woman who was losing my hair (health problems), and these products are the best! They don't have all the chemicals that regular products have! Try them!",4
"My scalp was itchy from just about every shampoo I tried...I bought this because I take black seed oil internally and often eat the black seeds and honey from The Blessed Seed.  I figured for a small investment I could always shower with this if I didn't like using it as shampoo.  First observation is that it cleaned my scalp very well...If I put black seed on my<br />scalp before bed, using the shampoo/soap in the morning removed all residue...But I do require a good conditioner afterwards because I feel this bar strips my hair a bit too much.  I don't use it every day...although I have washed my face and body with this soap and I like the sense of clean I feel.  Overall a good product...A bit on the pricy side and probably<br />won't last too  long but I liked it and would purchase it again.",5
"Hot stone massage is heavenly, I was excited to find some for home use. I use them for sore spots on my back and neck, and also have used them to warm my bed by putting the warm rocks under the covers for a few minutes before getting into bed. It's been an especially cold winter where I live so I am really enjoying this set.",5
Bought this dryer 10 months ago and it crapped out yesterday. Kept getting pushed for a review by the original seller and now that seller has disappeared. Going back to a Revlon or Conair that will last 10+ years!,1
Just what I needed for putting on makeup. It shows every flaw on my skin (ouch) and the different light settings make it versatile. it has a small footprint so it fits very nicely on my vanity table.,5
Broke in less then 2 weeks. Very heavy.,1
I like that these are not made of plastic but they are on the small side.,3
"The brush is extremely soft, works well on teeth and gums. It’s best to wet toothbrush then put toothpaste on, if you try to put toothpaste on first then wet, it slides it right off because the brush is so soft and gentle. The brush is a slim design so it can reach behind the back teeth even well. Nice product.",5
Softens the hair and provides nice styling by simply drying the hair.,5
Very beautiful. One came with a little leaked around the cap and they immediately replaced it.,4
It will intense every fine line of your face,1
This mascara was/is very disappointing to me because of the shape of the brush applicator.  It is much bigger and shaped with a curve in the middle of the brush that makes application very difficult.,2
Love this soap.  Just keep ordering it over and over.  This particular bar I gave to a friend as a house-warming gift.,5
These are not what I expected they stink like plastic. They don’t go on easy and some are so clear it’s like nothing on. It’s like putting plastic wrap on nothing like nail polish strips.,1
"I love that it's self-sharpening, and it definitely lasts all day! But there's something about the texture that makes it easy to make mistakes as you apply it. It's like it almost goes on too easy to where I often end up with uneven lines after barely touching my eye. And then it's hard to fix the lines because it stays on so well. I'm not sure if I'd buy this again.",4
Cheaply made and not worth it!,1
"🤣 it was a gift for girl with very thin hair. 1st use and top part just fell off. Put it back but it keeps popping out. Not usable even for thin, not tangled hair. Hair stayed fuzzy, people unhappy and surprise ruined.",1
The only butter that actually heals skin and not only moisturizes,5
Love this product. Leaves my frizzy hair soft and smooth.,5
"Works ok, brush is very dried out making it a little difficult to  use.",3
Like it very much,5
"Great nail colors, perfect viscosity for applying polish. Removed with light filing or soaking off with nail polish remover.",5
I bought these as a gift.,5
So cute!!,5
Really cute color and stays put - my hair is short now but this works great. Love invisibobble,5
"This is exactly what I needed for my small business to keep track of money, the bank account and bills.",4
"This works great, provided you use it with hair spray. If you don’t use hairspray with these fibers, you run the risk of them clumping up and being noticeable. However, with hairspray, you can go out all day without any issues.... I would stay out of the rain though.",4
"I had gotten this for someone as a gift.  This makes an amazing gift,  really.  It's really classy looking and beautiful.  The shaver comes with a travel charger/case and a plug,  and a stand,  and seems to work flawlessly on stubble and such.  Once your facial hair gets a little too long it doesn't seem so good though.  Either way,  amazing shaver!  And really classy looking!  I'm loving the color over every other color!",5
"I received this brush on a Monday, and used it just 4 times. First use I was a little surprised at the amount of bristles that came out but figured, it’s the first use... maybe there were a few loose pieces from manufacturing. Over the course of the week every use yields in dozens of bristles coming out, all over my bathroom or shower floor. I have used it for dry brushing, and the other times in the shower with body wash. After the 4th use it appears all the bristles have already fallen out of one hole, and many other spaces are losing the bristles fast. Really disappointed in this and to be honest I should have paid a dollar for this quality. Don’t waste your money or another second considering this awful product.",1
I buy amazon prime because I want to buy safe and reliable products.  Twice disappointed.  Twice bought Personal use products.  Today received my most recent order DHC coenzyme Q lotion.  Open unsealed old looking  box and a vial that is  Not sealed.  How can I trust a product intended to be used on my face when who knows what’s inside the bottle?  Dangerous.  Disappointed!  Should be 0 stars but there is no 0 choice.,1
"I love the softness of the product and how it makes my hair not only softer but blends my grays and the few blonds left into a more blended hair color. Brightens my grays as well. Love the way my hair feels after using it.  The shampoo is thin and creamy and the conditioner is thick and creamy. You don't need a lot of either of the products. There is no residue either. All you have is soft, shiny hair. My hair is naturally curly. Gray in front, some dyed blond areas that I am growing out, and dark brown from crown to ends.",5
I love this. I made a body cream with essential oils<br /> I will most certainly buy again.,5
This was a gift for my Grand-daughter and she loves it….. purple is her favorite color.,5
works as stated!,5
just what I wanted!,5
"Wish it had different sizes, at least 2, for the rest, it is what I expected.",4
I have the right hair color to tone... this product didn't work for me.,1
"I bought it for my mom (she is doing quimo) but couldn't resist to try it on, I didn't do any fix to the wig since its not for me, so this It's me with the wig as it comes out of the box.<br />Note: The hair Its really soft but messy to arrange, some hairs fell in the process of wearing it, never touched a wig before so idk, I still think is a very good product for the price.",4
Great  product  my favorite 👌!!!,5
Great for sensitive skin! Helps moisturize and helped my skin with blemish control!,5
I love these. Very comfortable and great sound quality.,5
Favorite makeup wipes. Good for sensitive eye area. and they are vegan and cruelty free.,5
"I’m not really a fan of this product for a couple of reasons. First of all, you are paying over twenty bucks for a “sample” that you would receive for free in a department store. Though I did not have a problem with the cleanser… The moisturizer burned my skin and I had to quickly remove it.",2
"I do not have thinning hair, but there are parts of my hair that I would like to be thicker. After trying Dr. Yates Keratin Fiber Hair Enhancer, I can say that this product helped me. The color matched well (I have dark brown). I sprinkled lightly over a small section of hair, close to my scalp. I could instantly see the area darkening and looking thicker like there was more hair there. The hair enhancer is a powdery-like substance that is really just a lot of tiny little fibers when you look up close. It comes out pretty easily when you shampoo your hair.  Made in Canada.",4
"First of all, there is a sticker over the charging lights, so you will want to remove that.<br /><br />My shaver came pre-charged, which was nice.<br /><br />Speaking of charging, one thing this shaver is missing is a cradle for charging.  You have to plug it in.  Not that big of a deal, but it would have been nice to have a cradle.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a very nice shaver.  It’s comfortable to hold, and smooth.  No “pulling” of hairs.  It has two shaver heads.  A lot of the less expensive models have only one.  I haven’t had any issues with “loose hairs” either – hairs that it doesn’t cut.<br /><br />I like that you can wash it with water.<br /><br />For the price, I don’t see that much difference between this one and a couple of the other Wahl models, which are lower in price.<br /><br />One thing that this one is missing. . . a way to “lock” it for travel, so that it will not accidently turn-on when something presses against it.  It really should have that at this price.",4
"I like Neutrogena products.  They are light on your face and clean it well.  It does not leave any sticky residue.  It cleans pores and leaves your skin with a tight feeling.  Again and again I have seen these products be successful with various skins types and conditions.<br /><br />Though of course you never want to get anything like this in your eyes, but I found that this burns more than most other products I’ve used.  I usually use this in the shower and other products if I’m simply washing at the sink.",4
Soft not overpowering smell.,5
"Excellent product.  Body wash works great with these, you no longer need a wash cloth, or back scrubber.  We wash ours in the washer with the towels and hang to dry.  Last forever.",5
"I've been using this tanner for a couple of years and I love it. Easy to apply, no smell and a great color overall. Would recommend.",5
These are 👍🏼,5
"It's awesome, I totally live how it makes my skin so soft. I use it most days since receiving it.",5
"These work pretty well for the occasional breakout. I just pop one on my newly formed pimple and presto overnight or about 8 hrs down the line it’s less red and definitely almost gone. Just need to be careful taking it off the plastic, very sticky and it can mess up how flat it goes on.",4
Very pretty and soft,4
More than I expected and exceeded my expectations.,5
I've got a huge black russian terrier. His hair gets matted pretty easily and I was having a hard time in the past with other tools. Even the furminator couldn't handle his matting. This tool wad a shot in the dark. Lower priced and worked fantastic. It sheds and dematts<br />Working like a charm for my large breed. Takes a little work but it's effortless. My only wish was a larger tool for larger dogs. This one does the job but it could cut my time down a bit if it was bigger.,5
"This brush has the perfect blend of boar and nylon bristles. It’s gentle on your hair while also pulling out the tangles. It does a great job of distributing oils so your hair is shiny and smooth. This brush is very nicely made. It’s solid, lightweight and comfortable to hold. Highly recommend it.",5
"I’ve had a few nail drills in the past but they were uncomfortable to hold and/or didn’t work very well. With the world being so messed up right now, I decided to try again and pick up this drill since my nails are in dire need of some TLC. I am so glad I took the chance because this thing is great! It’s super comfortable to hold and has just enough weight to it to feel balanced without tiring your hand. The cord isn’t super long but there’s enough length to give you some freedom of movement. I do recommend starting on the slowest setting until you’re comfortable using this because you could easily damage your nail bed if you aren’t careful. There are attachments for every step of the process, whether you’re doing acrylics, gels or cleaning up your natural nails. This is a great little device that really lets you take at home nail care to a new level.",5
Amazing quality and perfect size for all my cosmetics. Will likely be buying a second to accommodate my growing collection.,5
I really like the Braun Silk female epilator. Does remove the hairs while being a bit painful it really does the job. Time taking but the result is worth it. Super epilator.,5
Love these Tirtyl soap sheets. Of the many necessities I carry in my purse I love to have the soap sheets. Often when I am out and about there is no soap in the bathrooms. These soap sheets really fill the bill. The sheets are all scented and lovely but I really love the jasmine and patchouli. What a delightful scent. The sheets soap up nicely and I am really pleased with them. Great addition to purse necessities.,5
I absolutely love this Calendula soap with coconut oil. The scent is so light. The bar is relatively small. My skin feels so good and refreshed when I use this soap. My skin tends to be dry and this soap works so well for me. Love it.,5
These strap extenders are perfect. I don't mind wearing a mask. I wear one at my part time job and when shopping. However most of the ear straps are annoying and either pinch the back of my ear or make me look like Dumbo. Anyhow these strap extenders take the pressure off the back of my ears and are easy to set up. Super product.,5
"Colgate Total Advanced Deep Clean Toothpaste, 7.6oz is a super product. It makes my teeth feel super clean and I like the taste of the toothpaste. Twice daily brushing makes my teeth look great.",5
"First, this Beard Growth Kit, 10 In 1 Beard Kit For Men with Beard Oil, Beard Balm, Beard Conditioner set offers a nice number of items if you are considering a gift this holiday season (or any time). It’s a nice box, again, offers a good number of items for a gift, and is done nicely enough in box set up and presentation it would be well received. Second, the items in it are a good range of “quality” so I think it’ll be appreciated. What I am saying: the brush, comb, bag, scissors, and guard are decent, but not great quality. You can get better quality, but for working needs and for a gift, this is pretty good. But, for example the scissors feel a bit cheaper. But they will get use as long as they cut well enough. I’m not big into using a guard, but this one is like others I’ve had. The included bag is decent, but I’d never use it; if traveling or moving my stuff I’d use a toiletry bag. The brush is not as nice as others I have, but it’s useable and gets the job done. Same with the comb. That brings us to the shampoo, Conditioner, and oil. NOTE: I have extremely sensitive skin, so this review is based on my experience from that standpoint. I like a range of scents or items to keep my beard in good shape, but I have a far more difficult time finding things that work and are okay on my skin. I have only used these items once, but that’s all it takes to know. I come away happy - they all worked and NO reaction. I used the shampoo and conditioner in the shower today and they not only had a nice, light scent, but I was bale to let it sit on the beard for a few minutes each, having no issues with skin and liking the smell. The beard felt soft following and I liked how they worked overall. Next, the oil. I believe it is claimed to be used for “beard growth,” and maybe it’ll help with that. My beard is decent, but I do have spots that could use thickening, so again, I keep an eye open for options. However, there is no way to know if it’ll work for that for a few weeks if not months. So until then, it again did fine on my skin - not a single ounce of negative reaction. The sect is light, so it’s nice to smell, but one (my wife) has to get up close to smell it. I do like it that way, so it doesn’t bug my sinuses or overwhelm. In the end I’m very happy so far with this Beard Growth Kit, 10 In 1 Beard Kit For Men with Beard Oil, Beard Balm, Beard Conditioner set and happy I grabbed it. I’ll use it and if all stays well, would consider getting it again.",5
"First off, I have extremely sensitive skin overall, but especially on my face. To that end, I must be very carefully about what I put on. I do tend towards lighter or no scents, but have found some that work alright for me. But with or without scent, I can still have issues. In the end, it’s how my skin handles anything that is the bottom line for me. In this case, this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils works well for me and so far, I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I use a derma roller a couple times a week to help with hair in my beard and front of my head. At this point I then add a beard oil to these locations to help stimulate growth. Without doing major testing with all the elements, like a control group (area) of my head, it’s hard to say what works and what doesn’t. I feel like the derma roller has a large part in how well growth or at least slowing of loss goes. But, I have also come to believe some of these oils available do play a supportive role. To that point, I won’t be able to speak about this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils  for awhile. I have only just begun to use it - as a replacement for another oil.<br /><br />But I do like that 1. it’s not too oily on my hair or skin, 2. has little to no real scent, 3. feels fine and is not a problem on my skin, and 4. that it washes off my hands easily post application. Right now I like it as an oil providing at least some softening to my beard. Will it aide growth? We shall see...",5
"I will fully admit up front, I have a very bad sensitivity to scents. In my years of life I’ve only found maybe half a dozen I can put up with. I usually avoid them - but because I enjoy them - I do try to find ways to use it. Because of these sensitivities I try not to “blame” the product, unless it burns - then I have to question what all is in there. In this case, I decided to try Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine because of other reviews - I was hoping... but sadly, nope, I can’t do it. So I’m giving it 4 stars 1. because I do like the smell, but 2. it lasts far too long, smelled like it got stronger than lighter, and in the end, was too much for me. I got the Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine and both my wife and I liked the smell, but immediately worried it would be too much based on first sniffs. I put it on, and it worked great. It’s easy to put on - only a small amount covered my hair easily - and smelled nice. It was easy to work with my hair and it looked great. But as time went on, this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty started to smell more and more and more. The smell did not dissipate, but grew. And my head started to really hurt.<br />In the end, I do like this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine for how it works and how it looks. But for sensitive guys, you need to be aware, this putty has a strong scent - in my case at least, too strong. I won’t be able to keep using it.",4
"I drive my wife nuts when I trim my beard in the bathroom - I try to catch all the clippings, but without something like this, it does not work well. I thought I”d give this a try - it seems like a great idea, but...<br /><br />1. It arrived with 1 plastic bib, 2 suction cups with hooks, and 1 shaving cream brush.<br />2. The plastic bib feels okay - it’s a thin plastic, but it should last for a decent amount of time. It is not as nice as most of the kinds I’ve experienced or we own for haircutting<br />3. Its stitching is okay - I think it’ll last decently<br />4. There are two loops on the ends you will attach to the suction cups.<br />5. The suction cups - are worthless. This is why it gets the 4 stars - I would have given it 3 stars if we didn’t have our own suction cups to use instead of theirs. One of the two that came with it stuck for 5 - 10 seconds before it stopped working altogether. The other suction cup doesn’t even look right - it looks like it never worked and was not made properly.<br />6. We have suction cups (bought on Amazon) we were able to use - I looped that part of the bib onto them, which worked, but not designed for this, they would fall off. I’ll end up taping them to it - at least that way I’ll be able to use it.<br />7. It fit me fine. It felt fine - just like a haircut cape. The white looks weird - I’m used to the far more common black - but at the same time I think it’ll show the beard hair really well.<br />8. I did notice that as I go in closer to the mirror to see what I’m doing it folds over in front of me and isn’t as trapped out - be aware of this because it’s easy to start missing the catch in the bib.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent thing to have and it’ll make my wife happy not getting the beard clippings all over the place. This could be a little nicer -  a little thicker plastic, much better suction cups - which would easily earn it a 5 star rating. But for what it is, I’m happy to have it. If it lasts, it’ll be great.",4
This is the second set of different colors of this brand I have purchased and they are decent nail polish.  The colors go on strong and go good with nail art.  There is a bit of a funky odor but it's nail polish so you would expect an odor.  It did not take long to dry and the colors are great.,5
"This Kissio 9 eye-shadows pack is really nice! But the fun part is watching the shadow holder spin in circles in your palm. Once you open it, the spinning stops. So fun! There's 9 gorgeeeeeeeous sparkly colors to wear. I'll probably wear the majority of them over time. They're really nice and super easy to apply! Now that I'm retired, I don't wear makeup everyday so this pack will last me a long time. The shadows look nice and stay on for quite awhile before melting in the 90+ degree weather that were experiencing which created a drought here. But these eye shadows will definitely brighten up your day! I like them!",5
"These Scoot just spray bottles are fabulous for many uses. Most people use them for spraying beauty products, plants, hair spray, etc. However, I ordered them for my artwork to spray watercolor paint, inks, and acrylics. What I love about them is the fine mist and that you can see what product it contains. Also, once filled, you can turn the lock so there's no leaking. A very versatile plastic water spray bottle!",5
This Dance Midnight perfume by Shakira is really luscious and sexy! It has a strong floral and musk scent which is a heavier scent. It's very mysterious and breath takingly good. I love it! Even the bottle is sexy. It's a heavier scent that I usually love to wear during fall and winter. In spring and summer I will wear a lighter floral scent. I've worn this perfume 3 times now and get compliments each time. Usually from my husband too. I love this perfume!,5
"The rhinestones in these ""flowers"" don't catch the light very well, so only one really looked sparkly in the light.  Each clip has a bottom, 3.75"" long clip (with about 3"" of that for holding hair) with three 1"" long clips (with 0.75"" of that for holding hair) attached to it's top. The springs are strong, so they'll hold hair well. However, they're so strong that I have difficultly working them on my own hair. The ""flowers"" are also felt or some kind of stiff cloth glued to the plastic clip, so the ""flowers"" may come off with use.",3
"The package contained 3 microfiber Towel Wrap Turbans: one pink, one lavender, and one striped (orange, pink, blue, white). They are 26"" in length. After a shower, I've wanted to wrap my long hair up in a towel for a while because otherwise it drips down my back as it dries. But I've never mastered getting a towel to stay in place. This product does help: place the large ""hood"" section in place on your head, tuck your hair into the tail then twist the tail one or two times, and secure the elastic loop over the button. It stays in place okay as long as you don't try to pull a shirt on over it (or similar activity). I put it on for about 20 minutes after my shower, and the Wrap is pretty wet when I take it off. My hair's still damp, but it dries much faster after that and doesn't drip down my back. So it works.",4
"If you're looking for wooden paddle brush for long, fine hair, then this one may be just what you need.<br /><br />This brush is well constructed. It's made entirely of bamboo (the handle, body & bristles). However, the bristles are smooth. This results in a very sturdy brush that can easily work through tough tangles, but without causing unnecessary breakage.<br /><br />And the price is right (under $8.00 with Prime at the time of this review).<br /><br />If there's any downside then it would probably not the best brush to use on wet hair with a blow dryer because it's not designed for air flow.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for a good, sturdy paddle brush to use on dry hair, then this is the one for you.",5
"While this is a nice looking & seemingly well designed brush, I'm not really sure who it's best suited for.<br /><br />My wife has been in search of a brush for fine hair. And while this brush is described to work on fine hair, it barely even brushed through the surface of her hair.<br /><br />The bristles are so soft that it can't really grip. So just kind of glides over.<br /><br />It may be useful more as a beard brush, but unfortunately, that's not what it's being sold as.<br /><br />Giving it 2 stars for being a well made brush (wood handle is very nice), but just not very useful for its intended purpose, brushing!",2
"Dependable product from Mary Kay.  I was tempted to save money for a cheaper product, but after 20 yrs and many compliments, I will stay with this product.",5
"If you want to take a simple outfit to the next level, this is a quick and easy way to do it. They can be pinned to a jacket or blouse, and there is also a thick elastic band so that they can be added to a ponytail. They also look nice on some purses. They are stiff so they can handle storing several in one container. Some of the petals are made of a sheer fabric and others are opaque, which adds interest to the look. I have many of these in different colors, and I enjoy wearing them often.",5
"These flowers feel stiff and so they aren’t easily crushed and bent out of shape. They have a pin for wearing on clothing, and a thick, sturdy covered elastic for wearing with a ponytail.<br />I have several colors that help me add just the right amount of interest to several types of outfits. I’ve received many compliments while wearing them.",5
Not as expected,4
"I'm just missing, thick eyebrows - I do have hair, but you an see through them...not enough hair.  This kit helps me feel as if younger than my 65 years!  Pick an eyebrow ""style,"" use the frame and included pencil and I have eyebrows again!",5
"My grandmother had issues with patches of dark, coarse hair on her face/chin area as she got older and apparently I have genetically inherited that problem.  Therein lies the problem with using this appliance.  I must shave before using this thing and then I get to be ""pinched"" over and over on that sensitive skin where I just shaved...I mean, if you find something hurting you, do you go back to it willingly?  No...at least when I let the stubble get long enough and then wax, the pain from yanking that wax off is much faster and less painful that this light-pulsing machine.  So, that said, it's just not the way to get rid of hair for me.  If I had just a few hairs in one spot, maybe, but not the way the hair grows on my face/chin area.",3
"This bottle I bought to put a scant teaspoon into my home made ice cream to keep it from forming ice crystals after storing in the freezer.  I just bought a Cuisinart Ice Cream Machine and followed a simple recipe for chocolate ice cream, but I wanted to make sure that it would not become hard and full of ice crystals once I stored it in the freezer, so I did some research online and glycerin is one of several ways to keep ice cream creamy.  It only takes a teaspoon in the recipe and the other thing about glycerin is that it is sweet, so it blends in well with an ice cream recipe.  My ice cream turned out great and it is smooth and creamy after being in the freezer.  Now, this is not my first use of glycerin as I have used a small amount in water to spray in my hair.  Especially on really humid days when my naturally curly hair turns into a frizz-ball, spraying my hair with a 10 parts water, 1 part glycerin (or even less glycerin, depending) keeps my hair from frizzing out so bad.  For me, in ice cream or in my hair, glycerin works great!",5
"I do suffer from some foot issues and use heat/shiatsu massage on my feet for circulation issues, but these salts are for relieving pain when dissolved in very warm water in my foot bath/massager.  Okay, news-flash, I am a senior and not as active as I used to be but I am also very aware of keeping good circulation in my feet and making them feel as good as possible - arthritis in several joints means if I can lessen pain anywhere, I'll do that and my feet are important.  I can truly say that these magnesium salts really do make my feet feel so much better when dissolved in the foot bath water.  Because of my knees, I don't take baths any longer, but if I could easily sit down and get back up in the bath tub, I'd definitely try these salts in a nice long soak in the tub - I can imagine my whole body feeling as good as my feet afterwards!  Considering the amount I use in my footbath, this is not a bad price at all either.  When I use up this bag, I will be buying it again.",5
"I have a rescued teacup poodle that is a frightened little diva when I try to groom her.  I don't think the people who took care of her were nice or gentle with her in any way.  Poor little thing is only 4.5 pounds and she's fairly old and toothless so it's not like she'd turn and bite anyone trying to keep her looking like the pretty little girl she is.  I got this brush for her fine, curly hair.  She is a sweet little girl, but will ""bleat"" if she thinks you intend to hurt her and the first time I put a brush to her, she was shivering like I was going to do something bad to her.  I talked to her and took my time and by the time I was done, she was relaxed and let me work on her a little at a time.  My other furgirl is an older, rescued papillion and because her fur is straight with no undercoat, this brush works great on her.  She doesn't mind the brush at all and I think she likes how it lightly ""scratches"" her skin at the same time. Great brush for my two old girls!",5
"I have curly hair - very, very fine, but curly hair.  Because my hair is so fine, I cannot use traditional combs or brushes when my hair is either wet or dry.  I mean, all I have to do is one ""flip"" or have the wind move my hair once and the knots are there.  For many years, after shampooing my hair, I used a very wide pick to comb through my hair.  Even with a pick I have to go slowly since I will find at least one knot in my hair.  Anyway, this is my first time using a detangling brush and it's not a bad deal.  I still have to go slow, but I like how it goes through my hair more fully than the pick.  Definitely worth a try if you have curly hair!",5
"I remember my own children when they were small and how difficult it can be to ensure they all brushed their teeth at least twice a day - and spent a reasonable amount of time doing it.  I don't try to interfere with how my son raises his children, but I gave this to him so his kids, my grandkids, could have the potential for better hygiene than my kids had.  I have a similar one that I use myself and think this irrigator is a great way to ensure that they get good reports when visiting the dentist.  Great price for this small, portable unit that comes with its own travel bag.",5
"But I had to open it and spray some on my hand...and that was it.  I love the deep, spicy-sweet scent of this perfume.  It was a few hours before bed when I sprayed this and when I went to bed, I had my arm up near my nose - oh, it smelled so good and helped me relax and fall asleep!  Okay, so maybe that's not what you think of when looking for a great new perfume to wear, but it's not that it made me sleepy - it's just that it smelled so good I relaxed quickly and that allowed me to fall asleep.  This would have been a great gift for one of my daughters in law, but no...I can't give it away!  If you like that deep, spicy-sweet scent of certain perfumes, try this one.  So worth it!",5
"And while they don't seem to be bad, they just don't have the power that this one does.  I'm thinking it has to do with the size/strength of the battery in the drill's attached power supply.  While I do use this for my fingernails, I am using it more for my toenails and feet.  Toenails are thick and tough and I have trouble cutting them well even with good toenail clippers so being able to file them a little at a time is much easier.  Also, I have some very hard, thick skin on my feet and ""grinding"" that skin down is much easier that using a foot file.  This is a wonderful nail drill that's not just for nails - sturdy like a workhorse, it will make short work of messy nails or hard, callused skin.",5
"See, I have naturally curly hair.  The issue is when the weather is very dry over a few days' time, my hair goes flat.  Curly hair curls a LOT in humid weather; hence, the frizz which we deal with!  Anyway, I saw these and thought that maybe during those really dry winter days these would assist me in getting my hair to curl as it should.  Now, the problem is, curly hair ""fights"" with some hair items - from my younger years my sisters used bristle curlers (they had straight hair) but the first time I tried using them, my hair like BIT INTO those bristles and man, I nearly had to cut my hair off to get those demon curlers out of my hair!  These are similar, apparently to the bristle, demon curlers as they grabbed a hold of my wet hair and when I tried to pull one off, even holding onto the hair at my scalp, I could feel the tube holding onto my hair for dear life.  That was with WET hair...I'm glad I did not wait for my hair to dry before attempting to pull the tube off!  I have several friends with longer, straight hair and I'm sure they will have a different, happier and more comfortable experience than I did.  What I'm saying is that I'm sure they work - for those with straight hair.  If you have curly hair, best be careful when using them!",3
"Yeah, I have a physical job that requires I wear a mask while working.  I work in an non-air-conditioned warehouse so I sweat...having a headband that can catch some of the sweat trying to drip into my eyes helps, but now with having to wear the mask, having the buttons on the headband allows me to combine the two instead of having to try to hook the mask's elastic behind my ears and then pull the headband over my ears and getting it situated on my forehead.  Life has changed and finding the best way to work with the new normal is the only way to go...and this headband is working for me - maybe it will work to make it easier for others!",4
"But I have baby-fine hair that is also curly.  I always have hair around the hairline that will NOT lay flat or blend into the rest of my hair whether it is pulled back or down.  Oh, and don't even get me started on humid/rainy days.  Curly hair, especially baby-fine curly hair, frizzes like crazy in humidity.  So yeah, I could spray the crap out of my hair with hairspray and have one great helmet head with not a hair out of place, but I absolutely hate hairspray.  Besides, that would require washing my hair every time I coat it with hairspray - the problem is baby-fine, dry hair isn't made to be washed daily.  So...I have lived with all those crazy ""free-wheeling"" hairs until trying this product.  It worked so well I was amazed and it did not leave my hair feeling like a hair helmet!  I used the mascara-like wand around the hairline from one ear to the other and those little hairs stayed in place!  Cool beans!  I will buy this again, definitely.",5
"Usually I get a ""summer cut"" so that my hair doesn't make me any hotter during the summer months, but with the pandemic and all the salons closed, my hair is going to stay long over the hot summer months.  I can do many things with it and one is to keep it away from my face with these headbands.  I like the colors and the headbands themselves hold firmly in place which is just what I wanted.  I have some that had a twist in them and for some reason, they don't hold in place on my head very well like these do.  Colorful, comfortable to wear, and keeps my hair back - that's all I can ask for!",5
"I mean, you aren't starting with tons of colors or anything, but when you are new to gel nail polish, keeping it simple is the best way to begin the process.  The two colors are nice, but I am sure once a person starts gel polish, they will love it and buy a set of colors that suit them.  Now, the only thing I would change about this set is the UV light as it is very small.  I already had a larger one and am comfortable using my big one as I can fit all four fingers under it with ease.  Not that I have fat fingers or anything, but I just feel the included UV light is a tad smaller than most women would like.  Other than that, this kit will get absolutely anyone started properly in the gel nail polishing procedure.",5
"And it is working to soften up my feet.  As a kid I used to walk around barefoot outside all the time.  Asphalt in summer does things to your feet...so over the years I've had problems with calluses built up over time.  I put this on my feet and went to bed the first night.  Put it on again in the morning and have been doing that regularly over the past few days.  It does soften the hard, dry skin on my feet.  The scent is a bit funky - eucalyptus and menthol are not my favorites, but considering it is my feet...I can handle that.  Good cream for feet!",5
"I have very, very fine but very curly hair and am always trying to tame some little wisp of hair that refuses to stay in one place.  These clips are about the only type of clips that work well in keeping my wispy hair in place for any length of time.  The only thing that was a problem with these is that the side of the plastic these came in had torn and they were all over the shipping box.  I mean aaalllll ooovvvveeerrr inside the shipping box.  What a pain to pick all of these up...but I believe I got them all.  I do love these little clips and love all the bright colors that I can use for spring and summer.",4
"My niece is a professional and this is my way of getting professional work done without paying what she makes at her shop!  Of course, she does stuff like this for me and her mom (my sister) every once in a while when we ask!  So I got this and another tray for her to put on me and this tray was not really appropriate for my eyelashes - they were just a bit too thin to use on me.  The other tray worked much better so next time I will not get this set.  I'm hoping she can use it on another client of hers...might work for others, just not for me.",3
"I think part of it is choosing a good black under polish prior to adding the mirror powder as it needs that dark base to really shine and look like chrome.  I chose the dark blue to try first and it looked stunning when done!  The part I hate with gels is getting them off, but I'll work on getting better at that.  I love the tangerine chrome powder and will be trying that next!  These are gorgeous colors and I will be trying each of them in turn.",5
"But I have worn all the rest!  I love how these look on my head and they do a great job of keeping my hair back from my face when I'm working around the house.  I mean, I've used scrunchies to pull my hair up on my head, but after a little while that hurts my scalp.  These are gentle on both my hair and my scalp and they do look good (at least to me) on my head!",5
"Trying to get this right is the problem - it's an issue that can't be glossed over.  If you can do it right, it looks nice, but the chances are, you will move along your eyebrow with this ""pencil"" and it will look goofy.  I don't mean that you shouldn't try if that's what you want, but I'd rather just have a regular eyebrow pencil.  That is easier to use and generally produces decent results for me.",4
"I like having longer hair, but unless I braid it every time I want to do some work (or pin it up), it gets in my way.  I mean, if I'm trying to move a chair from one room to another and when I lean down to grab the chair, I also get a handful of my own hair which also covers my face blocking my sight.  Like my hair, hate that it gets in my way.  I have a few different things - scrunchies is one, but sometimes I don't want to wear them...so, I got these headbands for an alternative and they work great!  They keep my hair back just enough so I can work without it getting in my way.  These twist headbands also look pretty while holding my hair back.  Worth a try if you also have hair that sometimes gets in the way!",5
"Liquid body washes are my favorites, but some seem to dry my already dry skin out so that right after my shower, I have to slather on lotion to keep my skin from feeling tight and dry.  Not so with this one!  First, it smells so good - love the orange scent that envelopes the shower!  Second, a small dollop on my scrubby lathers up well and cleans thoroughly without having to add any more to the scrubby (like other body washes).  Last, when I step out to dry off, my skin feels hydrated and soft.  I really like this body wash!",5
"I have very, very fine hair - meaning that each strand of my hair is exceptionally thin/fine.  I have a LOT of hair, but because my hair is so fine, I have trouble with wispy strands  coming loose at the wrong places.  These type of clip work really well to keep my wispies corralled.  Granted, these are very brightly colored, but I have a few of the kind that blend into my hair.  What I was looking for was something that coordinated with what I was wearing so that I could ""celebrate"" my hair with the bright colors of these clips.  I mean, why hide ""difficult"" hair issues?  Or maybe hiding it in plain sight when wearing a Christmas-y red dress with red hair clips!  If you have wispies that escape and make your up-do look messy, maybe you too could try bright clips to celebrate your wild and crazy hair!",5
"That's basically what this is.  First off, the box is written in Chinese, I believe, with absolutely no English on it.  No instructions other than a pair of pictures.  Not great pictures either.  Not to be deterred, I opened the box, pulled one of the razors from the box, removed the plastic cover and tried it.  If you look closely at the one picture, you will see what appears to be a drop of blood - it is.  That is why I described this as a straight razor with a guard in quotes.  Make NO mistake, these are SHARP.  Use them delicately and only on smooth skin.  If you have a blemish, a mole or anything just slightly raised on your skin, it will be cut off.  You will bleed.  Just want others to be aware of what this is and to take care not to hurt themselves.",4
"Absolutely beautiful craftsmanship, easy to grip with hands, and I love the fact that this is bigger than commercial toothbrushes feels nice !",5
We use this for those between shower clean ups.  It is easy to use and very gentle and soothing.  Has not caused any issues.  Can really be used anywhere as it is plenty gentle enough.  Does a good job of getting rid of sweaty stink and leaves you feeling just showered fresh.  This would be great for travel as well as home use.,5
"These bits work well and are compatible with all the nail drills I tried.  The bits are good quality and seem like they should last a long time as long as you don't abuse them.  The set has some unusual bit profiles that we found very useful, especially for tighter spots or smaller nails.  The case keeps everything safe, in one place, and secure.",5
This is a great nail set.  It has all the bits you need to get started.  It is well made and spins at a high RPM (12000?)  Easy to swap out bits and the wand is easy to handle and great for fine detailed work.  I only use it on top speed but it does have 3 seed total and can be reversed if needed.  The battery holds a charge well and is enough to do a pair of hands.  Recharge takes about an hour.,5
We tried this out and so far it is working.  We have a noticeable reduction in the amount of hair in the tested areas.  It does take several weeks and several sessions to notice a difference.  Plan on at least a half hour per session (depending on how large of an area you are doing.  Make sure to wash after and use some skin lotion.  Follow the directions for skin and hair type and you should see good results.,5
"I'm not usually a fan of flower scented sprays, but my wife loves them so we gave this a try.  I was shocked at how well I enjoyed this scent.  It was floral, but not the usual sickey sweet scent I usually associate with floral scents.  This one was a lot better and almost woodsey smelling.  My wife loves it and was thrilled that I liked it too so now out whole house smells like this and she is happy and I can tolerate it!  Worth a go for sure!",5
"This is a very rich thick shampoo.  Salon quality stuff here.  Amazing lather, great scent and rinses super clean.  Works amazing for color treated hair, and perfect from stripped hair.  The conditioner is also incredible. I used some on my beard and it made it amazingly soft and manageable.  I caught heck from my wife as she told me this was to valuable for her hair to waste on my scratchy beard.  Oh well sometimes you can't win.",5
These shower caps are nice and thick and work very well.  They are reusable and fully water proof.  We used some of them to cover our metal detector electronics when we detector in the rain.  They work perfect for that application as well as a traditional shower cap!  We are careful to air dry these completely before storing them away so they won't mold.  They are see through so they work well for covers on electronics!,5
"These smaller spray bottles are very handy for sprayer needs.  We use them to most our plants, and to spray unruly hair.  They are a compact but work very well.  Nice and thick, but plastic so no worries of shattering them it they get dropped.  So far they have worked great and we have not had any issues.  The intake hose is long enough to reach the bottom and get most of the liquid.  No clogs or extra drips.",5
"My granddaughter (13) is real into nails right now and loves this set.  She did her own nails and her friends nails and I will say they did a nice job.  She said this was easy to use and worked as well as any other set she has tried.  Colors were great and the nails were strong and easy to shape perfectly.  The only real problem we had was this does have a pretty nasty smell, but we set up a fan and that took care of the fumes.  She has added this set to her growing collection of nail stuff, and likes to come over every couple of weeks to open up her ""salon""  I like it cause I get to spend some extra time with my granddaughter.",5
I use tweezers a lot and these are pretty decent ones.  They work for holding small screws and reaching hard to reach spots.  Not super fine tips but work for my needs.  I did sharpen and shape the pointed set a bit to use to remove some solder flux in a very tight spot.  Handy for most any detail work.  Scissors are so-so and will probably get trashed pretty quick in the shop.  The case is super handy and keeps the set together and is easy to slip into a pocket to take with you.  These would work pretty good as eyebrow tweezers also.,5
This is a good gel polish.  Works well with other gel topcoats and base coats.  Most of the colors were single coat coverage.  A couple of the lighter colors required a second coat.  Set up was quick and no foot or tacky spots after running the UV cycle.  Soaks off well and clean up was as easy as any polish. Loved the variety of colors and overall quality is great.,5
My wife really likes these for quick clean ups.  She uses them for after workout times when she is running late and can't take a shower.  Leaves her clean and feeling fresh.  Very gentle on the body even in sensitive areas.  Has a mild scent and does not irritate at all.  Wipes is large enough to clean the entire body and is very thick and soft.  perfect for travel.  Perfect for areas that may have little or no access to water.,5
This is a nice gel set.  Colors are vibrant and the glitter really stands out.  Super easy to use and setup was quick and complete.  Very easy to shape and overall the kit was a pleasure to use.  We even let our 13 year old granddaughter use it as it worked so well and was so easy to use.  She liked it so much she took several colors home with her to do some friends nails.,5
"I have this a try with a very negative attitude about it.  Wow I was shocked at how well this cleans ears, and how comfortable (dare I say it actually felt pleasant????) it was to use.  It is very soft and gentle on the ears.  Cleans very well and cleaning the tools was a breeze.  Case holds everything secure and keeps it clean and ready for the next session.  I use this once a week and very pleased with this product.  Heck even the mirror in the case is super nice and easy to use.  This is perfect for all ears.",5
These travel bottles are great for hand sanitizer.  Super easy to use and very durable.  The little holders are strong and attach to any handy ring.  Bottles are air tight so no worries on leaks.  Easy to use flip cap allows a quick squirt for a easy to use sanitizing routine.  The covers are nice and the fabric is holding up very well.  Easy clip allows easy removal for taking these bottles where ever you need them.,5
My wife has damaged hair and has used those hot oil treatments.  This works so much better and is not as difficult to use.  After 2 shampooing a and conditionings her hair looks and behaves so much better.  This has repaired the split ends and has tamed the frizzies.  Gentle on the scalp and leaves her hair so soft and shiny.  Safe for colored hair.,5
"First and foremost- this is a cream deodorant.  If you have never used a cream it is basically rubbing  lotion into your arms pits (anyone remember Tussy deodorant?)  We gave this a go and it smells really nice- a little strong (Jasmine has a very strong sweet scent),  but pleasant.  Did not irritate the skin at all and pretty much stopped odor (we did have a very sweaty 1.5 hour workout and by the end of that we were pretty stinky).  For normal daily use this works just fine and keeps you stink free.  It does leave a bit of a challenge residue on clothes so watch out for sleeveless clothing.",5
These masks work very good.  Very soothing on the face.  My girls have a beauty day about once a month so we are always trying out new masks.  These ones work great and they loved how clean and soothing these were.  They said their skin felt younger and more elastic.  Super easy to use and no I'll side effects.,5
"I love the way this Aloe works to cure dry skin problems and to soothe any skin irritation.  I use this on burns, and bites, and any other skin issue.  Very soothing and long lasting.  It cures the issue not just covers it up.  Super mild that even my sensitive skin is never irritated.  Smells like aloe and does leave a bit of a tacky- feel (that is what is supposed to do!).  This also works incredible in quickly healing blisters and bringing relief to raw skin.  Great easy to use bottle and no negative issues with this.",5
These foot stones work ok.  They do remove dead skin and calluses but are a bit rough and don't leave a smooth finish.  We end up following up with a very smooth foot file.  We tried using them in the shower and that seemed to work better so they get 4 stars for shower use but dry they are a bit too rough for our taste.,4
If you have never tried a glass nail file do yourself a favor and try these out.  Even as A guy I love how these work on my nails.  They leave such a smooth finish to your nails and greatly reduced the number of hang nails I get.  My girls love these and use them exclusively for all their nail care needs.  These come packaged in a padded case so your assured a safe chip free  file.  These are super quality and should last a lifetime.,5
"My wife likes these a lot for her workouts.  It has been a very hot summer and our workouts have gone from a little sweaty to drenched in sweat grossness.  These have not only kept her long hair out of her face, by have stopped the sweat from dripping down her face and into her eyes.  Gross yes but they work wonderful and wash up perfectly.  Zero complaints.",5
Tried these out straight away.  They work great and have a good level of adjust ability for different size heads and masks.  Easy to hook and unhook.  Very comfortable to wear and does not grab or tangle even long hair.  Colors are a bit on the feminine side of that matters to you.  Saves your ears from the pain and suffering associated with mask wear.,5
This has an odd shape.  It is almost pointed at the front and kinda like a crown.  It really is slippery and  kept pulling down when used with a mask.  Without the mask it kept riding up and would not stay put.  Very large writing on it made it a bit tacky.  Just didn't work for our needs.,2
My wife is a big fan of these hair ties.  They work well for her longer hair.  She generally wears her hair up in some kind of bun and these times work well for keeping everything in place.  They stay put but are easy and pain free to remove.  Just enough stretch to wrap up the hair.  These also work well in conjunction with bobbiepins.,5
First this is a real nice pointed top brush.  it is well made and very sorry and consistent.  The handle is also well made and tight to the brush (no wiggle).  Brush cleans up and dries soft and pliable.  It is a #4 size which is on the larger size for a lot of nail art.  This is probably best for solid designs or applying top coats and not for fine detail or complicated designs.  My daughter uses it to apply latex masks and peel off base coats.,4
My wife loves this headband.  Her masks hook up easy and this relieves all the ear strain the elastic bands cause.  It is stylish and comfortable.  Helps keep her quarantine hair (which is getting very long) manageable and out of her face.  Fits great and works wonderful for all day use.,5
These little spray bottles are awesome.  We filled up a couple with some scented oils and they work perfect.  The bottles are glass and are securely held in the covers.  They do not leak and spray a very fine mist.  The spray is perfect for adding a refreshing scent into a room (or a musty winter weary car interior).  Super easy to fill and the entire package is compact and fits easily into a purse or glovebox.  We also filled one bottle up with a little soapy water to spray on out house plants to take care of the fruit flies that are attracted to the flowers.  Excellent all round spray bottles.,5
This is non metal (i.e. plastic).  The tips are curved well but are kind of wide (they don't come to a point) and they flex a lot.  It takes very little pressure to get them to flex and as far as using this to scrape your teeth... well you would get almost no scraping.  This would be great for introducing kids to what the dentist does or for people with super sensitive gums.  I did give 4 stars as it it a good tool for removing paint from delicate surfaces and it is non marring.  Handle is comfortable to hold and I actually use this when clean my air guns as the chambers are small and tight and this won't cause damage and can get into the tight spaces.,4
"I love these wooden combs.  They are static free and on a great job of de-tangling the hair.  I have issues with static hair and these have solve the problem with the first use.  I have shorter hair so I don't even bother with a hairbrush anymore.  I really can't evidence which one is my favorite as I tried them all and love them all.  I won't go back to a brush or plastic comb ever again as these work amazing,  Also the finer tooth ones work great on my beard so that's an added bonus!",5
"My grandaughter and her friend love to give each other facials.  These are a huge hit as they are having a ball ""building"" there own face masks.  These are the perfect asorbancy for using as a face mask.  We made some simple face oil and water masks and the girls loved them.  The researched online and came up with a bunch of recipes that they are going to try on the next beauty day.  Great effective diy masks.  Size is perfect and they are durable and comfortable.  .",5
"Muy buen aroma, pero no tiene mucha duración",3
En mi caso no funciona,1
Helps with gingivitis  The taste is midly medicinal but is mild,4
I like these.,4
Didn't work like on tv. Returned,1
I purchased 3 and the clear bottle’s trigger gets stuck. Long spray time. My white and black bottles are excellent!!!,3
I've always liked the Mitchum products and this one was a good value. I did think the fragrance was a little weak and cannot be easily detected. Works well as an anti-perspirant,4
"Great shaving soap. Softer than a hard soap but firmer than a cream. Very easy lathering with very good glide, lubrication, cushioning, closeness, and a good post shave effect. Initially there was a slight animally fragrance but that soon dissipated after leaving the jar open for a day. Essentially a fragrance free product thereafter.",5
"Saw this puppy discussed a lot on various shaving sites. They all said that you have to watch the YouTube videos to get the right technique for lathering. I watched a couple and have been trying this now for the past several weeks. I must have tried close to 40 different soaps, creams and sticks from the most expensive to the not so expensive. This one is right up there in terms of face glide and lubrication.Certainly in the top quintile. Why 4 stars? I have tried every variation to get a lather but there is no getting around that this is the most difficult soap I have ever tried. Too much water, too little water it seemed impossible to get it right the first time. No matter what I tried it seemed to either be too foamy and thin or not enough water to generate a lather. It's as if the gremlin in the soap puck was contrary enough to defeat whatever I tried until the 2nd or 3rd try.<br />Bottom lime- With effort and persistence it gets the job done and the fragrance is mildly pleasant but it will never be my ""go-to"" product. I'll stick with may favs: Kiss My Face, Cella and Proraso cream.<br />UPDATE:<br />Gave it another try with a little more patience. It seems that the end product you want is a little on the thick creamy side and not really a ""lather"". If you wet your brush, turn it over and let all the water drip out that you can,then you apply brush to soap and be patient and determined you will get the thick rich cream that will do the trick. One other tip I found after you apply the cream to the face let it sit for about 20-30 seconds before you apply your razor. You will then get the greatest glide you will experience. Accordingly I have moved it up the top tier and displaced the Proraso cream.I would give it 4 1/2 stars, and not 5, if I could because of the difficult lathering.<br />FURTHER UPDATE<br />After using this puppy for a little while I have come to master it and love it. Great for glide and closeness and absence of irritation. I originally rated it a 4 but now after careful consideration I must admit that it deserves a 5 star rating. Its among my top 3 favorite shaving products.",5
I purchased for my daughter.  She has no problem wearing it. It's soft and comfortable.  It stays on all night long. However the black floral one left a nasty stain all over her sheets and pillowcase.  I washed it by hand before she wore it too. I hope the stain comes out because these are the best sheets! Very disappointing.,2
"I am impressed as this thing works. Gave it to my daughter and forgot about it. After about a month she came to me very happy showing her eyelashes. They are longer and more full. Also she tried it on her eyebrows just for fun, but it actually worked on eyebrows too. Just wow! Nice product.",5
I Will see if she holds up to a cut.,5
Tried the mixed shades with 1b.  1b is longer and smoother.  Will remove the brown/blonde and just go with dark strands.,3
"It was really pretty, but top heavy so it repeatedly slid down off my daughters head. Super bummed!",3
"Greasy, low saturation, did not stay in place.  I was wooed by the ingredients, but bummed at the performance of the product— especially considering the price point.",1
This is the best water bottle ever. It delivers a constant spray and makes getting your hair wet super easy. A must have.,5
"Looks good, nice and soft. Unfortuunately, I got a fluke, there is a hole in it. Not worth mailing back, so I will try to repair it. Here again, it is Betty B.",4
I received a sample of this calming cream in an IPSY bag and fell in love with it. It feels natural and really has helped the rosacea I have. I've used it in the morning but also at bedtime. It also smells great.,5
Super bright and vibrant! I love it.,5
"Good quality, nice looking hair sticks.. can’t wait to wear them!",5
Very cheap.  The conditioner feels water downed and does not condition hair at all.  Not one bit.,1
"It worked great at first but only a few months after using it, you can literally hear it power down to a slower speed. Was just drying my hair with it this morning and it was an audible change in the speed of it's blowing power- and the plug was in ok and buttons were not touched. It would go back and forth from normal to less powerful. Buy something else.",1
I really didn’t like the colors. I felt they weren’t neutral.,2
This is what my dentist sells in their office. So easy and fast to use! Works great... You can totally see results!,5
As expected. Good product.,5
I love the smell!!! Got it at k mart searched everywhere and found it on here,5
"Very natural mascara and not as nearly as volumizing as I’d prefer. It looks nice for running some quick errands on a no-makeup makeup day, but it’s not really a look that stands out. This can be good for some people who like a natural mascara, but I prefer more volume than this gives me. I don't think I'll reach for this very often. The overall quality seems good, but the formula is lacking for me. It doesn't build very well.",2
"This travel set of products is a complete winner for me, and the sizes are generous for minis.  I love the vials of the Priming Water and the Prime Essence. I actually prefer these two items more than the tube of primer itself, although it is good too. The two liquid products go on so thin and seamlessly, that it’s the perfect amount of primer to smooth everything out and help the foundation last. Sometimes full-on primers can be a bit too smoothing and it makes me feel like my makeup is going to slide off. Everything is very mildly scented (a mix of fresh & floral), but not overwhelming and the scent doesn’t stick around. The No Pore-Blem primer is nice and works well to smooth out specific zones on my face, but I don't use it all the time. For all over coverage, I prefer the Priming Water, followed by the Prime Essence, which makes my skin look and feel great, and helps my foundation look awesome.",5
"Can’t fit any makeup and close. No compacts, no eyelash curlers, no powders, no palettes. If you have super tiny makeup it might fit but then why not just use a pouch? Total junk and not worth the hassle to send it back. I donated it.",1
"These were not what I expected, very small.",2
"It's beautiful hair and it blended seamlessly with mine which I loved! No body knew it wasn't my real hair.<br /><br />The style didn't look great on me and there's a little round scalp on the top which unfortunately showed and looked weird.<br /><br />When I put it on in the morning I kind of felt like I looked like I was in an 80s rock band. That could either be good or bad, I guess. The photo I have here is with the top half clipped back.<br /><br />I probably would have kept it but I found a bug in it which really freaked me out.",3
"So let me start off by saying I have been using ghost bond wig glue for years now. I have always opted for platinum but decided to order the original. Unlike following ""wig gururs"" instructions I follow ghost bonds website instructions and I never have any issues . I have been able to swim with my wigs on and have no slipping it adheres well survives sweating and moisture and can support a 350 density wig. If you properly follow instructions you will have no issues.",5
"Kiddo enjoyed it, but it did nothing broke in 2 days. Buy a regular toothbrush",1
Gave these out as party favors for my daughter's 3rd birthday party.  The kids were all excited about them and my kids use them in the bath every night.,5
"This makeup covers so well, and the eyeshadow is amazing!",5
"This is not what I expected.  It does not do much to remove blackheads. My skin does feel clean and smooth after use,  however.",3
Gift well received,5
"I'm back to edit my original review from about a month ago.  I originally purchased the purple case, and this was my comment at the time:<br /><br />""I was really happy with the color and quality of the case, but every time I slide my new HP Elitepad into the case, it turns off.  If I pull the tablet out an inch, it turns back on.  But, it will not stay on if it is fully in the case.  Disappointing.""<br /><br />Someone from the selling company contacted me after posting this, and replaced it with a duplicate black case that does not have this same issue and works great.  I was really impressed that they went out of their way to resolve the issue.  I just figured I was out of my money and the case would go into the trash.  I'm upgrading the review from 1 star to 4 stars just because their customer service surprised me (pleasantly) so much!",4
I have been using it for about 4 weeks now. Shampoo is great. My hair don't feel dry and I do see some new hair coming out but not sure if it's from the shampoo or my new supliments I have been taking. I do like the fact that it's organic and feel safer to have my children use it too. It smells good and not so strong that I can smell my hair as it does with many other shampoos.,5
Like the fact that it's a roll on. Definitely helps with the waste of product. The smell is pleasing. Almost reminds me a little bit of a cupcake :) The serum feels almost a little sticky when you apply but dries out very fast and leaves beautiful glow. Not sure if I can say it tightened my skin that much but the glow is known to reflect the light and make vines less visible. Best part it's made of natural and organic products and that is always number one factor for me of buying anything that goes on my body.,4
Honestly when I ordered I was a little skeptical since I tried natural nail polish removers before and they didn't work so well but since I buy as much organic as possible I was willing to give it a shot. It removes nail polish very easy and smells great. Doesn't dry out skin either. Very happy with it.,5
"These brushes are great! They apply makeup so smoothly and look very nice.<br />I don't really care for the carrying case, but it was a great value. Highly recommend!",5
"Perfect, loved the shine!",4
"So convenient to just pump and use. I saw they used these in my dentist's office, and much nicer than everyone touching the cap with their germ hands..lol",5
"my niece just recently turned 10 and is starting to take an interest in styling her own hair. Since her favorite color is pink, I ordered this hair dryer for her birthday. She has told me so many times that she loves the hair dryer, she likes to talk about how she was able to use the attachments and make her hair do new things. My sister in law likes the size and says that it is easy to store in her vanity drawer, not adding to the bathroom clutter.",5
"I use mostly natural/oil products to clean my face, but I like to have something commercial for my morning showers. This is the only thing I've found that doesn't mess up my face and doesn't have a bunch of ingredients I don't want. They stopped carrying it locally so I was happy to find it on Amazon and stocked up!",5
The pump sucks. Doesn't pump out enough lotion at a time and is very inconvenient to use.,2
"I bought it for new home, when I open it. I will update product but it looks dueabke and strong",5
"Not worth the money, color doesn’t last long at all.",1
This is my go to powder for any of my foundations that I try on. It lasts for the whole day without any touch ups. I don't use a lot just enough to cover the face with a small amount to make it last the whole day.,5
They work great from keeping my glasses from fogging up. They are a one time use.,5
Nice and soft! But the actual bow part is just slick and floppy. It just looks like a lump of lace. The bow is not firm. Very disappointed. But at least they were cheap. I bought fabric stiffener to dip the bow in and make firm. Some I just cut the bow off and clipped my own on. Wish I had known before purchase.,2
its a little awkward to use it but it detangles my hair cuz I have long hair(past my waist) so I need a comb that helps me with my hair.little awkward but it works on what its supposed to do,3
Good product use morning and night on clean face.<br />Recommend a Vitamin C to use along with it.,4
Did not like at all color was way off from my hair,2
Goes on very smooth would buy this again,4
I was really surprise this wig is very cute I really like it easy maintain wet it a little curls right up .,4
"My niece live this, she said that it makes the curls tight and wavy. And it does not take too long to curl and the temperture is just right plus the accessories that come with it are really helpful.",5
"I have a very long beard which is quite curly. This works ok, just doesn't get my beard that straight",4
"lasts as long as a fart, and dos'nt smell that bad at all",1
they work,5
"I love the bright colors, they are a perfect summer look. I use a base coat and top coat after application. It’s a little runny so make sure you get it as thin as you can. Honestly the look and quality you get depends on how good you are applying it. I recommend it, especially at such a good price.",5
A novelty way to stay safe,5
veery pretty but fell apart after two wearings,4
it was a gift for someone,3
very nice,5
Would buy more! Definitely recommend them!,5
Great adjunct to good oral care!,5
These are good quality made applicators. I love them. You can reuse them or not. There are so many. These will last a long time.,5
"Recommended by our local salon by someone who works not only on hair, but lots of fingernails and toenails too. Recommended because it has worked for years. Nails like this are the things this goes after & heals.",5
"Yes! Here we go! As you can see, I made a commitment, while Amazon was offering a deal, to buy six varieties of this deodorant. I have known about aluminum and other things which are harmful to us. Somehow I did not know about these this product until now. Maybe I didn't look because I tried others years ago and was disappointed. So I will try to keep you informed and appraised as I begin this journey.",5
They are very nice looking but they didn't hold together well on the toothbrushes.  Kept coming apart and falling off,4
"Works what it's supposed to work for. Very sturdy and easy to use. Easy on the beard, it doesn't pull much but I only have a heavy goatee and mustache.",4
work well and not real rough.,5
This is a great brush. It also came in a cute package with a nice note and a free headband for keeping hair back while washing or applying make up.,5
These are the worst makeup sponges I've ever used. The quality is horrible. They are flimsy and have no substance to them. They disintegrate while you're using them. I've gotten much better quality makeup sponges from The Dollar Tree.,1
This little pushers are nice and I like them better than the wooden cuticle pushers.  Great little gift for my customers,5
Jackpot ! This is a fantastic product! Highly recommend. Will reorder.,5
Powerful and bright light. Excellent magnification. Attaches easily to my bathroom mirror. Good suction.,5
"Cheap quality, phone didn't work well with cover. Will request refund.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received replacement product that works much better. Seller responded very quickly and provided good customer service.",4
"Good stuff reliable, gets the job done,<br />battery lasts at least 4-5 days.",5
"I bought it to see if it worked better than double shaving with old fashioned Gillette (three blade) shave. Result, sort of. Be careful, follow the directions. I am not sure I will purchase again. Just shaving the old fashioned way easier.",3
"I run a day care and have about 20 minutes to brush through 4 girls hair to get ready for school. These brushes will go through bed heads, curly tangled hair, hair with food stuck in it etc in minutes. It has saved me so much time and the little girls are no longer complaining that the brush is pulling their hair. (yes I was gentle lol!) I also have waist length hair and I use one. It doesn't pull my hair and I have less hair in my brush when I am done. I love these brushes!",5
"I use these for masks rather than elastic.  They work great and they are softer.  Only issue was they were ""Glitter or metallic"" description did not specify, but still useable.",4
"The item is not intended for Hardwood use so why ask?  The item is not intended for picking up hair, but for removing loose hair from your pet so why ask about picking up hair?  The sucking power depends on your vacuum so why ask?<br /><br />Now to the item itself.  It appears to be well make although it is difficult to use due to the fact hat there is no trigger to alloy you to extend the bristles in place while using the brush.  I would give it a much higher rating if it had that feature and would use it far more often.  As is, it is somewhat usable, but cumbersome at best.",3
Love these combs! Very sturdy unlike other combs I’ve used. Love that it has the metal tail and the comb teeth for parting. Would definitely recommend for braiders or anyone that parts hair alot when combing.,5
I’ve purchased this soap before. It is wonderful.  My razoglides over my face. Product lasts a very long time,5
"This was my mistake when ordering....the hassels returning Amazon purchases will make me think it over carefully before ordering again.  After a 2+ hour ""chat"" with Amazzon, the chatter still did not get it & clearly had a lack of uderstanding English. Eventually another customer servivce emailed me & most of the problems have been resolved.I still have this 3/4 Helen of Troy that I don't want. This process of returns has taken over 2 weeks.",1
"thanks for supplying these shower caps at a reasonable price!  Yes folks, they are very thin, but will work well.  Just be gentle;",5
I hate bathing caps but sometimes I don't want to get my hair wet when swimming so I was looking for something stylish that wouldn't look ridiculous.  Think this will do the trick.,5
"This is my first experience with setting spray, so I was excited to try it and see what it does. I was not disappointed! I usually have problems getting my makeup to last all day without looking like I have sweated it off. I was pleasantly surprised when I looked in the mirror half way through the day and found I looked exactly the same as when I put my makeup on in the morning. No cakey makeup, and no makeup settling into the lines on my face. This is definitely a game changer! I do wish the spraying mechanism sprayed a bit more evenly, but I do greatly appreciate that it really doesn't have much of a scent to it.",4
"Aesthetically lovely rigid bottles. Great size for putting in purse/for travel. I have alcohol in one bottle type, and sanitizer in the other. I gave 3 stars as the lids don’t secure very well on to the tops of the bottles and can come off in your purse.",3
Lathers nicely. Definitely worth the money as it keeps me from getting razor burn.,5
Item is brand new as listed..  good setting spray for makeup.,5
Please bring it back. I can’t find it anywhere!,5
"I absolutely loved this wig, but unfortunately it didn’t love me. The color was too dark.",5
"Work great for eyewear, phone screens, and flashlight lens.",5
Waste of money,1
Very nice on older skin,5
Great product. My skin looks great!!,5
Nice,5
"Super thick and rich, gives lots of volume",5
Very cute for casual and pretty for dress up.  It holds ponytail in place.,5
"Good stuff, came in handy for an awkward mask job.",4
I love these brushes!  They are durable and they are soft on your head while being the job done.  I recommend these if you need a brush.,5
The product was referred by a vet for instant relief of dry eye.  The dog has become accustom to the drops.,5
"With 6 colors to chose from(purple wasn't the first, but it was pretty good), you can't go wrong, plus it actually lasts and doesn't rub off right away.",5
Color works well for my very pale complexion.  Good application.  NYC packaging is a bit cheap and flimsy but that doesn't deter me for buying the actual product.  Would buy again.,5
Product just as  described! Will buy again!,5
"i dont know what is so special about this brush ,,my mom bought me this for my massage business,all it is ,,,is a 99 cent painters brush u can get from the  99 cent store",1
"Great hair bands. You get alot for the price. Not cheaply made. I even washed them in the washing machine, inside of a lingerie bag, dried them in the dryer and they still held up awesomely.",5
"I had to use this for awhile before giving my review. I love this. I use once or twice a week with facial cleanser giving myself a mini facial. Very easy to use. After i use this, i use my moisturizer and oils with jade rollers.",5
"I have used it about four times in the months and it was ok. Not much of a difference in using a regular wet brush. I tried to use it today but it doesnt work at all. Not the batteries. Nothing is stuck. Just doesn't work. I missed the return deadline which fell during my week on vacation. Brush was home since i didnt bother bringing it. Now im stuck with a $20 brush that doesn't do anything. Smh. So disappointed.<br /><br />Update: the company did reach out to me after review to fix the issue. I updated the stars because of customer service, not product.",4
I liked the length. But the hair tangles a lot. It’s still a good deal for the price.,3
"This is an awesome product, a true value for your money.  It actually works and the price is reasonable.",5
This works just fine.<br /><br />The other brand uses plastic &#34;icicles&#34; to form the brush. Onlt thing i miss about those is the sharpness of the handle (it can be used to scrape the back of the tongue) and the built in tongue scraper.,4
This is wonderful stuff. I finally get some relief from my joint pain at night. The lavender scent is so much better than a typical medicinal odor. DMSO makes the biggest difference.,5
"Wow what a deal two towels and the comb!  Towels work great (actually, sending one to my sister, so the two pack is perfect! I love the comb too all the teeth very smooth as is the frame holding the teeth.  I have very tangley hair and it works perfect. Highly recommended.",5
Jewels were coming loose when I opened the package. Looks beautiful but I would hate to get the jewel setting tangled in my hair.,1
"This is my 4th electric toothbrush, and by far is the best performer.  Had a cheaper version of the Braun model which filled with water with regular use, and subsequently malfunctioned.  Reluctantly, we purchased this brush which is very similar in design.  As of yet, no water has collected inside the toothbrush.  This model is very powerful and does the job it is advertized to do.  We purchased this particular model because it is the only one proven to be more effective than regular brushing in a clinical study.  I agree that the results are consistent with the study, and hope that we do not get more water in the toothbrush (not covered by warranty, FYI)",5
"[[VIDEOID:f989859dba437111dda043bac274e8c6]] This is really good for my hair because my hair tends to break easily. These are velvet covered and very soft. They are so easy to use. All you do is open up, put your hair in it and close it up. They are well made and great colors. On the inside are these teeth all the way around it that grab on to your hair really good.",5
As I get older my skin seems to be drier and itchier. I can no longer reach all my back area and this loofah brush is great for getting those areas.  It is always fun to watch how big it can get in water. Not only does it clean my back but it also feels like a massager. It has a wooden handle that is removable and a rope through the handle to hang it in the shower. It is very well made.,5
"I am so happy that I finally have a flat iron to take with me when I travel to Greece this spring, it is my 1st dual voltage hair appliance so I am quite excited to test it out there.  My hair has a mind of its own, so I have to keep it straightened. It is pretty light weight and I really like the black color with the rose gold accents.  It heats up very fast and really left my hair smooth and silky. So far I am very happy with it and to me the true test will be when I go overseas. As you can see in my picture it has an infrared light strip in the center of  the straightener.",5
"My hair is fine and I have a hard time finding hair clips that keep my hair up, usually my hair slides right on through and falls down. I am very happy so far.",5
"I had bought myself a  heat cap for my hair because my hair is dry and it has really been thinning since I started becoming middle aged. My sister gave me this deep condition protein  hair mask a few months ago to try. I have been using it once a week and my hair is definitely a lot softer and shinier. The one thing that really sticks out is the smell, it is very pleasant and not over powering.",5
"I can't believe how fast this flat iron heated up, it was like instantly. It has a nicely lit LCD screen. All the buttons are on the inside, which is good since I usually hit the controls on my hair curling wand because they are on the outside. The temperature is adjustable, I only needed it about halfway since I have a finer hair. It does come with a heat resistant glove, instructions and a carrying case/ storage bag. There is a little loop on the cord so you can hang it and the cord also rotates so it doesn't get all tangled up.",5
"My hair is always breaking and coming off in my hair ties, so recently I have started replacing all my normal hair ties with hair items that are less damaging to my hair. I really like how these hold my long hair snug in a ponytail and they don’t pull on my hair when I take them out. I love the colors too, teal and black are my favorite colors.",5
"My husband and I are getting ready to take a trip abroad. I was worried about what I would use on my hair, because it has a mind of its own. He surprised me and bought me this flat iron for our trip since it is dual voltage. I have thin hair, but I have a lot of hair and with this having temperatures from 230 to 450 degrees I usually only have to set it at 350 for my type of hair to get it straight. It have a very nice LCD display that is very easy to read. This is a 1 inch ceramic tourmaline flat iron. It worked great in my hair making it very soft, shiny and smooth and it was done very quickly. I also like that it has an auto shut off, since I can easily get distracted. It comes with a very pretty satin drawstring bag, that will be great for putting it in my luggage.",5
My grand daughter used this on many different areas of her body for high lighting purposes. She really liked it. Said it went on easily and stayed on. She is very fair skinned so it looked really nice and stood out. You get 4 colors and they are a matte with a sparklyness to it. It is a compact design and worked great for contouring also. She had no irritations or problems with it.,5
"I have very dull and lifeless hair, I think it is from too much sun and abuse growing up My hair is light weight but very frizzy so I have to use straighteners or curling irons to have it look decent. This has definitely made my hair shiny and looking great. I just sprayed it on damp hair, I combed it through and then I used a flat iron and I have also used it with the curling iron and I loved the outcome. My hair definitely had alot more life to it. I think if your hair looks good you feel good about yourself. The smell of this spray is amazing, it is like a fresh melon scent. It is super easy to use and I love that it gives my hair a layer of protection from the heated hair appliances and the sun. It is for all hair types and it is very light weight.",5
"I have kind of fine hair, but it is like I have alot of it. My hair normally when I curl it is flat within 1 hour tops. Even when I use hair spray, to even get it to hold I have to use alot of hairspray and then my hair feels so stiff and gross looking. This hair spray held my hair all day long and my hair was not at all stiff or hard or sticky, it was very free flowing. I absolutely love the smell of this hair spray. You adjust the spray flow on the nozzle. So depending on how I want my hair to be for the day is whether I use  the light, the medium or the high spray.",5
"My 18 year old grand daughter does her full face make up everyday whether she is leaving the house or not. I will admit she is pretty good at it, but she does spend alot of money on it. She had been using a sponge type and what she said that she really likes about this blender is that there is alot less waste of makeup, since the sponge absorbs it and this silicone blender spreads it. She said it spreads alot more evenly also and she was very happy with how she could clean it easily in water after each use.",5
It severely dried out my lips and made the inside of my mouth swell. I do see others have also had bad reactions to the rosy lips stick.,1
"Not quite as much coconut scent as I was hoping for, mostly vanilla, but it is still nice.",4
"This item is garbage! I returned it immediately.  Not only does it not work, the premise of the product  is ridiculous. It’s just a thick plastic poor quality hair brush that doesn’t slide through the hair. Don’t waste your money or time.",1
"Have been using the &#34;Grandma Agafia&#34; product lines for a few years - they are superb.<br />The aromas are not overpowering or objectionable, and all of the ingredients are natural.<br />I am an over-60 male with advanced male-pattern baldness. If it were not for these products, I am sure I would be slick-bald by now.<br />When I started on the propolis formula almost ten years ago, I WAS slick bald on top. A month of using the shampoo and my scalp started sprouting &#34;peach fuzz&#34; hair - not a full recovered hairline by any means, but it showed that the shampoo was doing its job of cleaning the scalp and supporting follicle health.<br />I have much less breakage, and the hair I have left retains its thickness and diameter.",5
great shade matches,5
These work well for holding your hair up.  I use them to help keep the heat in when I henna my hair.  They were a great price and I have tons to use for future uses!  I would recommend these!,5
This crown was beautiful and a heavier weight so it didn't feel cheap.  I think my future daughter-in-law will cherish it for years to come (as a reminder to her fun bachelorette party)!,5
This product is nice but it seems to weigh my hair down making it flat and uncooperative.  Just not what I was hoping for.,3
Very lovely piece of art.  Very pleased--but it may be a gift for someone special.  ;),5
Perfect!,5
Item as pictured. Its lightweight and great for travel! Requires 1 AAA battery and good to go! Comes with 3 attachments for quick and easy touch ups. Have used it briefly and it worked without issue. I would recommend. Its an inexpensive and portable nail drill!,4
I used this product before. It works very well. I reccomend this prodoct to anyone with a large water bed.,5
"I really like these scrunchies, I have very thick hair and these actually hold my hair in place. They’re soft and cute.",5
I don’t know how I ever did make up and hair without these.  Makes the process so much easier and doesn’t leave annoying dents or lines.  So happy with my purchase.,5
The Scent is nice but I was disappointed that this brand does not suds like the Dr. B brand.  I used the same amount and had no suds by the time I got to my legs in the shower.,3
I first tried a tiny sample and then went looking for the product to buy. This stuff is great and smells good too.<br />It soaks into the skin very quickly and your skin looks great in the morning. I usually use it at night and another SPF 30 for the daytime.  If you notice the recent trends for face care is the Facial oils-  this product has been around for awhile- which is probably the groundbreaker for the Cosmetic industry finally getting on track with natural products.  LOVE IT.,5
"I am sorry, this product smelled so bad before I opened it.  Had to return it....",1
Easy to wax with these strips but they don’t catch very small hairs.,4
Great quality and looked amazing,5
I love the quality of these pads!  Will be purchasing again.  They are soft and absorbent.,5
excelente perfume...me gusto mucho.,5
dont waste your money buy a metal brush this didnt last at all,1
Blades keeps moving all the time while scraping. Screw keeps unscrewing on its own,1
It's often the only hair dressing I use: great product.,5
love this stuff,5
This has to be the BEST nail set I've ever purchased. The color is mystical and the blades are precise. 💯,5
I loved the color. It is very textured so you need a glitter topper. Also use a basecoat cause I didn't and it stained my nails badly.,3
Good value for the amount but they are not as thick as I would like. I like them for a night out but I wouldn't wear them for multiple days.,4
"After some hit or miss orders of this item in the past, I recently ordered from 'JapanSuperMall' fulfilled by Amazon and these are the real deal, authentic Salux beauty skin cloths.  They are the 'harsher' authentic ones not the softer knock offs.",5
Gorgeous and really good quality picture is from when I received them used them already and still the same quality after drying really recommend this brushes,5
"I'm disappointed⭐⭐👎👎 with my lume bar of soap 🧼 the warm vanilla bar, because I can still smell 👃a monkeys butt 🐒🤢🤮🥴😩, the body wash is better 👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",3
This products has an extremely unpleasant odor and is very sticky. Nothing at all like the old White rain gels. VERY dissappointed.,1
I love the scent  will be getting  more.,5
"I was so excited when I saw I could order banana combs!  I couldn't wait to get them.  I still have some old ones from back in the 80's.  Anyway, I was so disapointed in the ones I ordered, they are so stiff.  The plastic is very hard and not pliable and makes a difference in your hairdo, plus it's not comfortable, it might as well been made with glass.  I will stick with my old ones!",2
"This comes in a box much bigger than the actual product so be warned. It's very small.<br />Over priced for the amount you get.<br />It does smell good and works ok. It looks very classy, the packaging looks high end but it's just not worth the cost.",4
"I followed the instructions and this did not work as advertised. I thought this would be a great alternative to the traditional method of gel removal, but this was disappointing as this did not remove my gel polish. I tried 3x and still no result. Don’t waste your time or money on this product.",1
Works well...bought a second one for a second location!,5
Lasts a long time....a good way to refresh your razor.,5
"Well made, and a good case for smaller items.  I use it for a travel razor, but you could use it for small electronics, hard drives, etc.",5
Quality is OK...seems pretty good for the price.  The case doesn't close without a little force...the larger clippers are a bit big.,3
smell good ans i have to keep buying this for him,5
Very pretty got a lot of compliments on this! It is a little heavy which have me a headache but I think that unavoidable.,5
Too thick of a band. Doesn't work for my fine hair type looks too bulky,2
"Purchased this for my in-laws. They could not find it anywhere else. Pricey, but it should last them forever!",4
"I bought this to provide in-wall power for my 2nd generation iPad (30-pin connector). The kit comes with all the connectors pictured; you supply your own CAT-x cable for the Connection between the power supply and voltage regulator. Before putting it in the wall I set it up with my iPad and charging cable and found that it wouldn't charge or even power the tablet. The USB jack has only the power wires connected but nothing on the data lines, so neither the iPad nor my iPhone 6+ would recognize it as a charging supply. I could I'm sure modify the connector or make my own adapter but I ended up abandoning the project in favor of another solution because I needed it working within a couple days.<br /><br />Build quality seems fine, it does what it says though the Ethernet pass-through port is only 4 wires so it can only carry 100 MBit data.",4
"The rubbing required with this makes it less gentle that advertised.  I found this to be harder on my cuticles and natural nails than I expected it to be.  Had to cut them down after using twice related to that.  Disappointed, especially for the price.",3
Not very shiny,3
Color is not true to picture or description given.  Polish is gloopy.,2
Nice quality and price. Fast delivery AA++,5
I was so excited to receive these! I started using under eye foundation and wanted to use a brush instead of the sponge. When I went to use on of the brushes all the bristles were uneven so I thought no big deal I’ll just cut the ones that are longer than the others. After that I used the brush to apply liquid coverup and the bristles started to come out! Very disappointed but I guess that’s what happens when you get cheap makeup brushes.,2
"well i would have to say i didnt know the diff in the grams of hair and what that meant. However after hours of research i do now. These are great as far as feel construction and look. However very very thin and not at all the coverage i was expecting. On my hair which is 4 inches long all the way around i would def need a second pack to make them look anywhere close to real hair. soooo... i added them to an existing hair piece for now till i can order in another set. on a brighter note they are def worth the $$ if you are not looking to fill a whole head!! Quality of the hair is good, and there was minimal shedding.",3
"Raves from my daughter, a professional hair stylist and her co-workers",5
Smaller than expected,1
Pretty good for the money,4
This is good for the reason I got it.,3
Poorly made - cheap quality. I returned it,1
Love love love this.<br />I have a body dry brush that’s a little bit rougher and I love that the facial version is softened for more sensitive skin.,5
Bangs on the front are way too long and throw off the whole dimension of the hair!,3
Smells kinda funky but works great.,5
They are what I needed. I could no longer find them in stores so have to pay more online. The only thing is they are really stiff to open,4
Product came,5
did not work at all like not even a little,1
I love how it feels.<br />Once you put it on your hands and rob them - it dries almost instantly.<br />There is no smell and it give good protection,5
There was hardly anything inside the bottle and it is so gummy that you cannot use the dropper that comes with it. If this is how the product is supposed to be than it should be in a different container so it is easily accessible.,1
I was excited after reading the reviews to get this set only to be disappointed when it arrived. Upon opening the package the fingernail clip broke after the first time trying to use it. That was disappointing. The big toenail clipper worked great but I had to return the set because of the broken one.,2
This is a little bit of a mess.  It is very thick and the wand is huge.  I could not even use it right.  I wonder if it is stored too hot so it causes the thickness?,3
This set of stones is just gorgeous!!,5
Thanks,5
Beautiful,5
"I like the style of the mask, which is very trendy. Camo is one of my favorite. The mask are also super stretchy. However, the mask are super  thin too, which makes me wonder about their ability to perform adequately.",3
"I wasn’t even aware of the lock feature, but now I don’t think I could live without it. Wand heats up quickly and does not snag or tear my hair. I also have a mixed daughter who’s hair I straightened and it took way less time than anything we have tried before",5
Great!  Will order again when I need more brushes.,5
Pretty when swatched on hand.  But looked ashy on my skin tone when actually applied.,1
"Evolve Boar Bristle Purse Size Brush<br />  I needed a new brush for my purse & now I have one!  Just the perfect size & weight for my purse.  Lightweight yet sturdy.  No plastic!  This brush would also be perfect for a toddler's hair or an elderly person's thin hair. No sharp edges to poke you!<br />  I have never had a boar's hair brush so I suppose there is a bald boar running around somewhere!  Not in my neighborhood, I hope!!<br />  I just hope I don't lose this brush!  I have a hard time keeping brushes.  Usually, I lose them.  Sometimes my cat decides he likes my brush, so I give in.  He needs to stay out of my purse!<br />  I'm hoping this brush works out.  Then I will graduate up to the larger sizes.  I think the plastic brushes are rough on my hair & pull some hair out.<br />  So far, I'm loving this brush.  It really smooths & tames my hair down  If you want a natural soft brush, this is the one for you.  I don't use this brush on wet hair.  I switched over to a wide tooth comb.  My plastic brushes are in the trash!!<br />  I did receive this brush at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  I love it!  Thank You!!",5
"Callus Remover from Smooth N Clear<br />  How can this actually be fun?  Well, not fun-fun, but interesting.  I can't believe how much dead skin comes off while you are &#34;sanding&#34; your feet!  It is amazing!<br />  No amount of foot scrubs or using the little egg with blades could do better.  This Callus Remover is so easy to use.  When I am finished using this remover, I admire & touch my feet - then I put lotion or vaseline on & then some white socks.  I wear the socks overnight.  In the morning, my feet are so soft & free of dead skin & any beginnings of calluses.  Easy!  I don't use the remover every night, just maybe once or twice a week.  Maybe, skip a week.  So it doesn't feel like just another chore.<br />  This Callus Remover comes nicely packaged & you get a cleaning brush & 2 rollers.  I just wish I knew where I could get some extra rollers.  I feel the machine itself might outlast the 2 rollers.  If I find some rollers that fit - I'll update my review.<br />  I did receive my remover for a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  Thank You!!",5
"180 Cosmetics C Booster Vit C Serum w/ hyaluronic acid & Vit E<br />  This products says it helps with hydration, elasticity & suppleness.  It's true! That is exactly what it does!<br />  I use this serum morning & night on clean skin. You just need a thin layer.  I use it on my neck also. Then, just as the directions state- add your moisturizer.  Very easy! I put what's left on the backs of my hands.  I am trying to get into the practice of using the same products on my face &  then on my elbows & backs of hands.  It really makes a difference!<br />  I like the look of the bottle & the thin jelly-like serum.  I've had other Vitamin C serums & I like 180' the best.  It makes my skin look hydrated & feeds my wrinkles some nutrients.  Hard to describe!  Not a 20 year difference but I am 66.  I still look like me-just healthier.<br />  I did receive my serum at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  It's great!  Thank You!!",5
"Majestic Pure is one of my favorite brands. They offer a money back guarantee & offer quality products. This Retinol Moisturizer Cream is another winner. You just need a bit & it feels so silky & smooth & so does your skin. There is no oily, greasy feel & didn't cause me any burning or redness.  It was refreshing & the added moisturizer kept the Retinol from drying out my skin. I did receive this cream at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!",5
Great moisturizer!  This cream does indeed absorb into the skin.  It feels refreshing & it doesn't have a scent to me.  I've been using a lot of various serums & having an actual cream to use is a nice change!  The pump dispenses nicely & there's no waste.  Quite a lot of uses in the bottle.  I'll be using this for a quite a while-Thanks for a great product!,5
"Love this brush!  It really fits in your hand & feels so good on your scalp!  It does the job for detangling without ripping my hair out or breaking the ends off!  I laid the brush down & the next thing I knew, my cat was rubbing his chin on it!  A sure sign that it's a good brush!  I'm getting my granddaughter one because she uses a brush on her wet long hair.  She really needs to quit pulling & breaking her hair.  Thanks for a great product!",5
&#34;Great feeling cream! Cool going on. Liked the e-book on Anti-Aging tips. I'm working on my &#34;marionette&#34; aging lines starting to go down from my mouth. They actually look less noticeable. This may just be the cream to soften & MAYBE get rid of them! Keeping my fingers crossed-Thank you!&#34;,5
Great!,5
the brush is just to big making it difficult to apply.,4
Not as sticky as some are. Good for the price tho.,4
"These tattoos are beautiful but they completely rub off in about 2 hours! They also smell like moth balls. Add to that the fact that Amazon won't return my money, and I am very disappointed. Don't buy these!",1
They did not have enough pressure to keep the nail polish remover pads tightly on my fingers.  You get what you pay for,3
"I have the updated version of this.  It's the Braun Silk Epil 9 SkinSpa.  I think the technology has improved, as I find it much easier to remove all hair in the area.  I mainly use this on my legs and underarms.  I had the basic Silk epil 7 with the smaller head and felt like I needed to go over an area several times, which worried me - was I creating too much friction.  With the larger head and cleaner removal, I think that concern may be gone.  I also store the newer version in my shower, as I really like the body brush.",5
"Worked perfect.  Put a top coat on right away. Otherwise it will come off. The pic is what it looked like the next day, before top coat.  Rubbed off at tip. That's user error though. Otherwise it's perfect.",5

"My girls are trying to grow out some of their hair from a few years ago when they decided to cut some off with kid scissors. It's taken a while and while it is growing back, it tends to fall in their faces. This set of bows is a nice way to clip that back. You can use them like little clips but they also have bows on them, so they look really cute on them.<br /><br />The bows seem to be good quality, we have used them several times a week for two girls since we got them and none have come undone or had any problems. They are really a good way to make them look put together, even when they decide to pick out their own outfits. These work really well for the front, side and we have even clipped them over pig tails/pony tails a few times and they just look sweet.<br /><br />I am very happy with the quality<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT  (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

"I have been looking for a way to organize not only my make up, but some small art stuff on my bed side table. This acrylic set is exactly what I have been looking for. The first part of the set is a large organizer with drawers. Each drawer slides out nicely and even has a little black liner inside to help keep the bottom clean and keep things from rolling around. This is especially helpful with make up items, which can leave a mess.<br /><br />The next two pieces both can fit perfectly on top of the organizer. It has an indent on the top that keeps the other organizers from sliding around.<br />One has a curved area and the other has small box like shapes. These work well for make up sponges.<br /><br />It gives plenty of space for keeping everything within reach and organized.

"I have never used a bath bomb, mostly I have used bath salts and made my own bath treatments, but had heard so much about bath bombs that I wanted to try them out for myself. I use essential oils so this one looked especially good to me. There are no funky ingredients or chemicals in it, so that was a huge plus for me. Each of the bath bombs has a name and what it is for. My favorite right off the bat was the grapefruit for energy. I was having a tired day and needed a pick me up, so I took a hot bath with one.<br /><br />The bath bomb took a while to dissolve, so it lasted quite a while, then the water turned lightly colored. It was nice to feel on my toes as it dissolved. The smell was lovely, however it didn't last too long. On the next one I used I just dropped a few drops of essential oils that matched the scent, so it helped it stay scented longer.<br /><br />All in all it is a lovely luxury to pamper yourself or give as a gift.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

"Scrubs are a nice way to get rid of dead skin, so this seemed like a good way to go. It isn't full of a bunch of chemicals and is similar to a salt scrub. It's not all wet, so don't go wiping it on your face without first getting it wet. The best way to use it, in my opinion, it to take a little pinch/scoop of it and add it to your body scrubber. I think an electric face scrubbing brush is fine it you have shower doors or a shower curtain to keep any pieces from flying all over, but this helps get the scrub really worked into the skin. You can also use it on a body sponge/wash cloth or even with your fingers.<br /><br />It doesn't have a terribly strong smell, it's actually quite mild, which is fine because you don't always need to smell strongly with purfumes and fragrances. Over all it's a good scrub and works well for what it is used for.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

"I have never been the type of girl to stand in front of a mirror and do make up for long periods of time. I have used a hand mirror for years, I prefer to sit somewhere like a bed or couch and do my make up. Using a hand mirror is harder though because you then only have one hand to work with the make up. While I don't do a ton, opening things like mascara or doing eye liner is a lot harder when you only have one hand.<br /><br />This mirror stands up on it's own, so you don't have to hold it. It has a pretty red exterior and it even lights up. The light is not a really bright one, but enough to light up your face if you are in a room that is not as bright as you would like. The rim lights up on both sides, the regular mirror side and on the zoomed in mirror side. There is a place to plug it in, but no plug, so you can choose that option if you have a plug. I used the 3 AAA batteries that it came with. It works well for me to be able to do my make up without having to stand in the bathroom and I don't have to hang onto a hand mirror.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

"I try and use all natural products, in my hair and body care. I was hoping this would be, but there is a sodium laurel sulfate at the end. It's not as bad as most, it's mostly natural, but that is one I prefer not to use in my hair care. I passed the bottle on to my friend who normally uses pantene, so it was a lot healthier for her to use less chemicals over all.<br /><br />Her hair looks great and the shampoo smells fine. It has a soapy smell, which is fine. It goes on fine, she said she used one pump for medium length hair, and it washed up fine.

"My husband has a very thick beard, and maintaining it is a lot easier with some beard oil. This bottle took me by surprise, it has a dropper top similar to those in essential oil bottles (which makes sense with the dark blue bottle and it being made with oils like jojoba)<br />The oil goes on easy, he can just shake a few drops out and rub it in.<br /><br />He uses a boar bristle brush to help him get the oil down to the skin, it helps his beard stay softer and it has grown a lot longer than he usually lets it get. By now he usually gets fed up of it being itchy and shaves, but the oil stops the itchy issue.<br /><br />The bottle is 4 ounces, so it will last quite some time.

"There are so many uses for tweezers, and I am used to having some from brands like Revlon and such that are okay, but they are not very high quality. The ends are usually dull and they have a hard time grabbing anything. I was extremely happy when I opened this pack of 3. They are a sturdy stainless steel metal, no plastic or cheap aluminum. The ends of the silver one are extremely pointy, perfect for pulling out things like splinters and anything that might get stuck in the skin. My husband was working and ended up with a large splinter under his finger nail. Since you can't exactly get it from the top, we decided to use the silver sharp pair of tweezers and were able to extract the splinter from under his nail. They also work very well for removing hair. I pluck from time to time and the black and pink pair are really nice for that. The silver is easy to get out any ingrown hairs.

"No one tells you when you are young that your face will break out even as an adult. Especially when things are stressful or it's just that time of the month. I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth. My skin feels softer, is not breaking out, and my husband even noticed a difference.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

"I have very thick hair, for a long time I had a mat of tangles at the base of my skull that used to take me up to an hour to detangle. My hair was getting unmanageable so I cut it off. After donating 4 pony tails to locks of love, as my hair reached all the way down to my knees when I was standing up, I thought my hair would be easy to care for. But if I'm not careful, I still get very bad tangles in my short hair. Now that I am starting to grow it out again, I thought my troubles would be back, but I received an opportunity to try this brush at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased, review. (all opinions are my own) I took my hair down from it's ponytail and ran the brush through, figuring it would get caught fairly quickly. To my surprise, it didn't really snag at all. It actually did as it claimed. My hair was smooth and the spot at the base of my skull that always gets missed no matter how hard I try, was also smooth and untangled. I am really shocked. I have tried so many brushes for myself and had sort of given up on finding something just for me. I will be keeping my brush in a safe place so my kids don't lose it and recommending to all of my friends. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again. It is worth the money.",5
Really love the elastic loop to keep the tail in place.,5
"Huge hit with family and friends. The kids loved them, and so did the adults. The kids had a great time applying the tattoos on everyone. Highly recommend.",5
I bought this for my teenage daughter who is 14 and she absolutely adores it. It's very cute and I must if you're a Harry Potter fan.,5
This is a very nice quality make up palette. My daughter wears make up alot I don't so much so deciding on the right one was difficult for me but she had been asking for this so I got it for her and I am so glad I did. She looks lovely and uses it all the time. It is great it doesn't irritate her skin or bother her at all which was something I was concerned about since she has sensitive skin. It goes on lovely and the colors are very nice not to bright but you can see them easily.

"This is a great shampoo it is a rich thick product that feels so nice and smooth when  you put it on your hair. It works into a nice thick lather and when you rinse it is super silky smooth. I am such a fan of all natural products and even more a fan of essential oils and now my hair looks and feels like i had a spa day that was in the comfort of my own home. Argan oil is effective in thoroughly cleansing and improving the health of the scalp, removing any impurities, and acting as a natural antidandruff remedy. Which is something i truly need since i have a super sensitive scalp and water even seems to bother it alot of the time.  It also contains pure organic argan oil that works to leave the scalp feeling refreshed while locking in moisture and shine into each strand of hair. I am so delighted to come across this product and used it this is one that I will use for a very long time and highly recommend it to everyone else.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review thank you",5
"I love these bibs!  My son really needs these, he is one and a bit messy. He has lots of teeth coming in and lots of sisters who enjoy feeding him lots things.

This set of loofah scrubbers is the best I have ever gotten. I didn't expect them to be so big and nice but I am really pleased with how nice they are. They are good quality and full not flimsy so they don't fall apart. They are well made and very nice and strong. They are long enough to really get my back easily while I am in the shower. This is a huge set of five sponges they will last a. Ice long time. The colors are nice and bright and the handles are attached well so I can hang them to dry with no worries. This is a great set I am glad I was able to get them.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review.,5

Tweezers!!!!<br />This is a great set of tweezers. Pink is my favorite color so right off the bat they get a plus for that. But seriously they work great. They are really sturdy and well made. Not those cheap ones that bend really easy. With three different pairs each with thier own unique job you can't go wrong. They have a nice sharp pinch at the end to grab the little hairs and get them gone. These tweezers are awesome they are great tweezers. I am so glad I was able to get these. This is an excellent set that I totally love.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price for an honest and unbiased review.,5
As I get older I find that I need to be a bit more creative with what I do to treat puffy under eye woes. This is a nice new product that I thought I would give a try. I am so glad I did. It really is working to improve the way I look and feel. It is really making a noticeable  difference in my appearance. I like the results of using it just for the small amount of time that I have been. The caffeine and retinol really do make a difference. This is a natural product with some good ingredients. I am so happy I got it<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to give an honest and unbiased review.,5
I really appreciate plant therapy and all they do to bring natural healthy herbal products to my home and my family. I don't have to worry about harmful ingredients I know with their products and I'm getting exactly what I need and what's best for my family. I got this so that I could get soothing foot rubs for my wonderful son who loves to give them to me. It is so wonderful it smells so good and it feels so good I'm so pleased with this product. It is everything that I could have wanted in a body cream. I purchased this product reduce price to give an honest and unbiased review thank you,5

"This anti-age cream is a good product, but it's more like an oil than a cream.  It is moisturizing and works well for that purpose.  It's a little messy since it's more of an oil.",3
The Blackhead Remover Pore Vacuum Cleaner just didn't work for me.  I did like the directions for the product which were easy to follow.  The device has different settings with a light to indicate what suction setting you are on which is a very nice feature.  The device just did not remove my blackhead.  The USB charging cable that comes with the device was very short and did not come with an adapter to plug it into an outlet so I had to borrow an adapter to charge it.  I like the silk bag that it comes with for storage.,3
"I love this soft pink color. Perfect for a light makeup.<br />It run smoothly on the lips, I do use a primer  before because I have very dry lips.<br />It last at least all morning and then all afternoon.<br />Even if the color is soft, the lipstick have a good pigmentation.<br />No weird scent.<br />I like it!<br />Recommended.",5
"This is a great option to the expensive hand tied extensions, plus you can put them in and off when you want.<br />The hair is soft and shinny, feel very good quality. It hold very good straightening or curling iron.<br />The weft has clippers so it can be more secure to the head. And the wire is adjustable to the size and shape of your head.<br />It is not extremely heavy, but you can feel it when you first put it on, but after a couple of hours you don’t even remember is there.<br />I saw quite a few videos to install it correctly and that made the difference so it can be completely invisible.<br />Comfortable to wear, the weft is not itchy.<br />The pack comes with the hair in a dust bag, a comb and a hair pin.<br />Recommended.",5
"First, this treatment is profesional use… I can seee that because definitely I couldn’t do it by myself! It is not a simple or fast process.<br />The liquid has a very strong chocolate scent which I prefer over any more chemical scent.<br />You need to follow the instructions very well.<br />I have very thin, short natural wavy hair and I think we did something wrong along the way… hahaha…<br />Although my hair does feel softer and shinier. But I don’t have a “Brazilian straight”.<br />The liquid is chocolate also in color but I did not see any difference in my own hair. So it did not dye it.<br />Is a good product, and if you are like me, not super handy with brush and hair dryer, you better ask for help so you can follow through the steps.",4
"I wanted to love it, but i just can’t.<br />It smell good, it spread easily. You don’t need too much of it for the entire face. My skin did feel moisturized after using it BUT i just can’t stand the stickiness!!!! I tried with several amounts of it and i could not sleep at all because of the sticky feeling. It was too much. It did not absorb into my skin. Obviously every skin is different, mine is sensitive and dry.<br />The consistency is like a heavy gel.<br />So, for me is a BIG no, but i will use it during summer after sun tanning, before shower. I can see that would be best for me....i even think it will work great if i storage it in the fridge before using it... just like a cooling gel.",3
"A couple of times during the year I get my heels very very dry.<br />I ordered this mask and it was great!<br />It start peeling around day 5-6.. and it was soo relaxing!!! Just like when I was little and we use glue on our hands! Haha..<br />Well, my feet are soft and almost all the dryness got out.<br />Easy to use.<br />No strong scent.<br />It did not make my skin red or itchy.<br />Love it! Recommended.",5
"This set comes in a plastic box, nice detail because you can use it for storage.<br />The clips are bigger than I was expecting, but they are perfect. I have very thin hair and medium length.<br />I like that they lie flat on my head. So they don’t hurt me if I’m using them for long periods of time.<br />Lightweight and well made. They feel sturdy.<br />The set also comes with hair ties, love them! Very soft. They are made on 1 piece of fabric which helps on the hair.<br />I really like this set.<br />Recommended.",5
"I was hoping more of this oil.<br />First it does not have any árgan type of scent... on the contrary it smells like fried oil. Not good. It is not super strong scent, but definitely you can smell it.<br />Second, it does not absorbe fast. I was oily until I fell asleep.<br />It was lightweight.<br />I did felt my skin hidrates the next day, but not quite sure if this is better than other oils that I use.<br />Definitely, I won’t use it, because mainly of the French fries smell.",2
"This was my first attempt to do faux eye lashes. I can not compare to other systems, but I love it! I use the 3 pair from the top. The look was pretty normal. I had to cut a little of them because it was too long for me.<br />The set comes with 2 eye liner, tweezer and 5 pairs of lashes.<br />The liner was easy to apply and then the lashes were stuck on it fast and easy.<br />I went to a barbecue with them and they stay in the entire time.<br />After, they go out without any pain. The eye liner was a little hard to take off. I use my makeup wipes in a hard way. Haha.<br />It did not make my sensitive skin hurt or burn.<br />I love it!",5
"This is beautiful. Not only the box is very nice, but the case is stunning! Looks like a smooth shell. Very luxurious. Perfect as a gift!<br />It is however, because of the material, like a ceramic or something, very heavy. I think it will not be good as a pret a porter kind of makeup. But perfect for the one you leave on your makeup vanities.<br />The colors are perfect for my skin tone, I’m like a light brown tone. But I’ve found myself using it more as a eye shadow than bronzer.<br />The highlighter gives a pop of glow.<br />No scent on it and it stays perfectly during my days.<br />Like it. Beautiful!",5
"First of all, I don’t use to much makeup, no thick layers of foundations. Just some primer, concealer, eyes and mouth.<br />For me, they worked perfectly! They are pretty wet, so they took off all my makeup easily.<br />They are small, so if you use more layers of make up you maybe are going to need more than one.<br />They are soft and have a nice scent.<br />I have mixed skin and delicate. They did not hurt me, burn me, or leave my skin red.<br />After using them, my skin feels clean and moisturized. Not greasy or dry.<br />And they come in a super handy little box, perfect to carry around on your bag.",5
"I love this set! Even though I don’t need 6 of them.<br />They are well made, very stretchy, so I guess they fit a wide range of head sizes!<br />Super super soft. The fabric is thick.<br />Comfortable to use, it does not squeeze the head. But it holds all the hair back.<br />I use it when washing my face. It keeps my hair dry too.<br />I love the bow! Very 50’s!!!<br />Great colors. Like it a lot.",5
"The concept behind this set of masks is pretty cool, and the names are cute.  The masks themselves, however, aren't anything to write home about.  They smell fresh in a more herbal kind of way, and the textures are a mix between creamy and gel-like.  The big issue I have is the container design.  The bowls come with a good sized amount because a little goes a long way, but there's no way to seal them back up for later use.  I had to put them in ziplock bags.",3
"I couldn't use this but one time!  It broke me out, dried me out, irritated my skin, and the rose scent is overwhelming.  The texture is fairly decent as far as cleansing balms go, but it's a very aggressive cleanser and not in a good way.  My skin felt rough and raw when I was done using it.  I've used Clean It Zero for a while and highly recommend it over this balm.  Steer clear!",1
"This is a really nice lighted, mirrored compact!  So many times, the lights aren't bright enough to do you much good, there's only a single regular mirror, and/or the size is just too small to give you a proper look.  Not so with this compact.  You get two mirrors for the price of one, a regular mirror and one with a higher magnification for those times when you need a closer inspection.  The light has a lovely, and very helpful, color temperature that's pretty close to daylight, just a bit warmer, and is featured around both mirrors.  It's operated by a switch on the bottom, so you aren't wasting your batteries.  It runs off of two coin batteries.  The mirror is larger than most.  I have larger than average hands for a woman, and this compact is bigger than my palm.  It's a great size for quick once overs and more detailed makeup application.  I even prefer using it over my bathroom mirror for doing my eyebrows.",4
"After falling in love with the C.O. Bigelow Rose Salve, I knew I had to give this a try.  I haven't been disappointed with the results.  Not only does it have a sweet, citrusy smell, it also moisturizes and softens my dry, chapped skin.  I deal with dry hands in the winter and I'm a big hand washer, so I end up with rough, cracked skin.  This light yellow, creamy hand lotion has helped to keep my hands from feeling like sandpaper without leaving them greasy.",5
"I thought this would be a fun wig to wear to bed, if you get my drift.  It's cute and the colors are blended together nicely, with small streak of lavender mixed into the blue.  The ""scalp"" looks great and is a nice nude color.  It mimics a Caucasian scalp really well, which is great for a pale gal like me.  The cut is sweet and it's styled well.  The bangs need trimming up but that shouldn't be a problem.  The tresses feel like all synthetic wigs do.  They are wavy but still have that plastic feel to them.  The big issue for me is the size of the wig cap itself.  I have black hair and the wig ""scalp"" is so short that several inches of the top of my natural hair shows through it.  It does come with a hair cap but oddly, it's black and not nude, which would be the smarter choice.  I have a nude hair cap that I'll be trying with it, but I'm not expecting much difference.  The wig is just too small in general.",4
"I'll be honest.  I was rather skeptical when I received this.  It looks sleek and pretty but does it actually work?  My answer to that question is a resounding YES.  You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.  I think the price for this item is fantastic!  I have a reduction in blackheads, my skin seems to glow after use, and my products are sinking into my skin better and faster.  This one for the win!",5
"I'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.",4
"I've always wanted to get into the art of doing my own acrylics so when I saw this drill set, I knew I had to review it.  Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves.  The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)  Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge.  The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it.  The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet.  Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.  It works a bit too awkwardly to be something I'd use that often.",3
"I really enjoy this UV lamp.  It's sleek design and concept make it easy to use.  I like the buttons designated for each separate drying time and the LED display is easy to read and understand.  It works like a champ and does a great job!  I truly think this lamp is worth the price, and I think you'll like it as much as I do.",5
"These are great cotton rounds!  I used to get the CVS 360 brand but they were getting expensive because I used a few each day.  Luckily, I found this huge pack of awesome rounds.  They are super soft but not so soft that they don't hold up when wet.  They are fantastic when you don't want to waste product because they absorb just the right amount and actually extend the life of my products.  The price is low and the amount of cotton rounds in this big pack can't be beat!",5
"These are good for those late nights when you’re too exhausted to do your whole routine, although I HIGHLY recommend doing a quick double cleansing regardless.  They seem to remove dirt but don’t work well for removing oil-based makeup.  Make sure to understand that this has to be rinsed off, or you’re falling asleep with soap on your face.  I won’t be repurchasing.",2
"This kit is a great deal!  I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.  The results are worth it!",4
"This is a very nice magnifying mirror, in a beautiful oil rubbed bronze finish!  Especially for the price point!  There were very similar items for twice as much, but I'm so glad I chose to purchase this one for our bathroom.  My husband is starting to get more gray in his beard than not, and has been having trouble seeing it all while shaving.  I got this for him (and for myself, but don't tell him) and he has been thrilled with it.  The three lighting choices are gorgeous and very useful, as is the 10x magnification side of the swivel mirror head.  I'm thinking of getting one for my mom and sister, as well.  Great buy!",5
"This wig goes greatly with the Ahri outfit! The wig is super comfortable and smooth on your head. I absolutely love the tail ends of the hair because of the yellow and pink combination color!! The wig goes down a little past my chest area. It may feel a a bit heavy, but is not too bad to wear for long periods of time for an event.",5
This product goes well with lightening up your eye. I found it is helpful to make my Asian eyes a bit bigger! I love the cute pink color and it makes your makeup much more attractive and more attention! Less is more is a helpful tip as the product can go on a bit much.,5
The clips are larger then I expected. The colors are nice. The quality seems to be good. Overall it is a nice set.,4
"Ready to use straight out of the box. The color is pretty retro but it works. You will notice that it doesn't come with an outlet connection just a USB cable. You get a total of 6 brush head so you don't need to worry about replacements for a while. The brush heads aren't my favorite but they aren't bad. There is a control for the strength of the vibration which I love! It also gives notification after every 30 seconds, which is really great. Over all I am really happy.",4
"It does everything it says it will. I like the simple style it has, and it is very easy to use.",5
"If you want an inexpensive skin treatment for your skin to moisturize and keep it fresh and young-looking, this product has some good ingredients.  It says safe for dry and sensitive skin.  I have combination skin, and it works fine for me.<br /><br />Ingredients include: 100% Vegan Hyaluronic Acid - professional hydrating serum,enriched with anti-aging Vitamins C+E and Green tea.  Also included is Jojoba Oil, Retinol and Aloe.<br /><br />It fills in fine lines and plumps your skin, reduces age spots, brightens skin etc.<br /><br />It is paraben-free, cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, vegan, and is a serum.<br /><br />The price at $5 an ounce seems to be about 1/3 of other similar serums.<br /><br />I use a rotation of products on my skin as each product has strengths and does what others don't.  This seems to exfoliate a bit, and moisturize.  My skin looked good the morning after I used it.  You can put it on under foundation the company says.<br /><br />It has about a 3-year shelf life.  You will probably use it up in the first month or two.",4
"This goes on easily - has a metal rounded surface which emits watery liquid slowly.<br /><br />It does firm up the skin around the eye as it dries.<br /><br />I guess it would be great to put on before a party if your eyes are puffy.  And at night to reduce puffiness in the morning.<br /><br />Right now I like this product.  After using it for a longer time, I might love this product.<br /><br />It didn't hurt my eyes, sting, or get into my eyes as some eye products have done in the past.  The ingredients appear healthy.<br /><br />The product kind of rolls on like roll-on deoderant used to do.  So, it's not messy.",4
"This is NOT to put on your skin.<br /><br />This is to drink.<br /><br />My husband and I tasted it and liked the flavor.  It is a yummy orange.  The expiration date is January, 2019.  So, you don't have to drink it right away.  You DO need to refrigerate it.  And use it within a month of opening it.  You take one tablespoon a day, and follow with 8 oz. water.<br /><br />This is fairly expensive.  At $79 - about $2.50 which is an inexpensive meal.",4
"Like the container and the pump action.  Product feels pleasant with a light scent. Not wild about the scent, but if this works, it's okay.  It goes on easily.  So far, I like the product.  After using it a month, will decide if I love it as for what it does for my skin.  Like the natural ingredients in the product.",4
"Eyebrow Stamp Stencil Kit, Double EyeBrow<br />Stamp Kit, Perfect Eyebrow Powder Stamp<br />Makeup with with 24 Reusable Eyebrow<br />Stencil,2 Eyebrow Brushes and 1 Eyebrow<br />Trimmer (Dark Brown + Medium Brown)<br /><br />My wife got this eyebrow stamp stencil kit for faster application. These arrived quickly, not that<br />well packaged but did not have any damage. She said that using the stencils does take some<br />getting used to, and the medium brown is a bit on the reddish side. However, the stencils<br />themselves are great. Since using these, her morning makeup routine has been faster than<br />before, now that she’s gotten the hang of using these. Four stars.",4
"Not Or Omega 7 Sea Buckthorn Oil Soft Gels,<br />Anytime Face Wash, Facial Defense Oil, Skin<br />Cleansing, Skin Moisturizing Core Kit<br /><br />This facial cleansing wash, with sea buckthorn oil soft gels, and the facial defense oil, seem to<br />work really well together. My wife and daughter both get small bouts of acne during the month<br />and they’ve both benefited from this kit in diminishing breakouts and gently keeping their skin<br />clean and moisturized. They both want to continue using it and see if the soft gels make a<br />difference, but until then they are very happy with this kit. Four stars",4
"[The Skin House] Wrinkle Snail System<br />Cream (1.69 fl.oz / 50ml) Firming, blemish,<br />repair, anti-aging<br /><br />It took my wife a while to try this cream since it was made with snail mucin and to her, that<br />sounded less than appealing. However, once she did try it, she liked it. She said that it left her<br />skin softer and well hydrated. It doesn’t have a bad smell, which she was concerned about, and<br />the consistency was smooth and not sticky. She has combination skin, so this cream will be<br />good during the winter months when her skin is dryer. However, she said she will use a lighter<br />cream for the warmer months. Four stars",4
"Facial Steamer Nano Hot Steam Face Spa<br />Device Ionic Face Steaming Machine for<br />Home Facials Personal Moisturizing<br />Humidifier Vaporizer for Skincare Beauty<br /><br />My wife has always wanted a facial steamer but didn’t want to spend too much money. So,<br />when I saw this one, I thought it was a good deal. So far, she really likes it. She says that the<br />water heats up quickly and the steam coming out is smooth and doesn’t spit out any water. The<br />little cool mist steamer will come in handy on hot days, which will be coming up soon here in<br />California. Even though this comes with some acne removing tools, my wife has not used those<br />so cannot comment on whether they are effective or not. The steamer and mister, however, has<br />been something she really loves. Five stars",5
"Facial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic<br />Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep<br />Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle<br />Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging<br />with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds<br /><br />My wife has used many facial cleansing tools in the past, but wanted something with a little<br />more portability. After reading more about this brush, she liked the features it mentioned and<br />decided to try it. It arrived well packaged, and undamaged. It came with instructions and a usb<br />cord. After trying it for a while, my wife said she really likes the shape and the way it feels in her<br />hand. It is easy to maneuver around the contours of her face and she feels her face is getting<br />cleaner after using it. Although she likes the red light feature, it is not something she uses<br />regularly. She does like that it is small enough to carry in her purse. However, one of the main<br />reasons she wanted this is because of the waterproof capability. But with the usb port open, she<br />really does not feel comfortable using it in the shower. That was a disappointment. Also, it<br />does not come with a carrying case or bag, which would have been nice. I am giving it four<br />stars because the features we are left with are good ones and my wife feels that her skin has<br />improved since using this brush.",4
"MD Complete Bright & Healthy Citrus-C Refresh Retinol + Vitamin C Multitasking Treatment<br /><br />My wife got this multitasking treatment of vitamin C and retinol, to combat uneven skin texture and fine lines.  She used it for a while and afterward said that at least for her skin, she didn’t notice that much of a difference.  There was some brightening, but not effective enough as some other skincare products that she’s tried.  Overall, it may be good with those with minor skin issues, or maintaining good skin, but not if there’s a skin issue that is trying to be reversed.",3
"Hylunia Facial Day Lotion - 1.7 fl oz - Anti-Aging for Wrinkles - with Shea Butter, Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Zinc - Natural Vegan Moisturizer - Rapid Skin Repair<br /><br />My wife has recently started using Hylunia skin care products.  So when she saw their Day Lotion, she thought she would give it a try.  She is very happy with the results of this product. She said it plumps and smooths her skin and absorbs really well.  It goes on well under her makeup and does not cause her foundation to streak.  Even though it is a little pricey at around $67.00, it is definitely a product worth paying for.",5
"NATURAL Moisturizing Facial Masks (ALOE VERA 4PK Box) | Deep Moisturizer Face Sheet Masks for Dry, Sensitive and Tired Skin<br /><br />My wife really liked this moisturizing face mask with aloe.  She suffers from allergies, so her skin is dry and sensitive during those times.  This face mask contains clean ingredients, and is perfect to get someone with allergies and sensitive through harsher weather months.",5
I use this to wash my poodle and I love it!!,5
"This is a nice little nail lamp, works just as it should, well made and it's pretty. Comes with some nice extra gifts as well. 5 stars!",5
"I love this! Now I can set my nails in no time! No more nicks in my polish because I can't ever seem to let them fully dry before I have to do something! This thing is wonderful! I have only used it with regular nail polish so far, but my daughter has some gel polish I will try next. If anything changes I will update my review. I have a feeling my daughters and I will get plenty of use from this. Nice little machine!",5
Purchased two in late June. By August they are both not working. The light used to be bright and now just flickers off and on very dimly. Changed batteries. Still same thing. Don’t waste your money folks.,1
"What a soothing and wonderful lavender smell this lotion has. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all. Moisturizes nicely, yet is not heavy. I find the fragrance very relaxing, with a natural lavender smell. I am enjoying using this product.",5
"Nice salt scrub, leaves my skin feeling so soft and smelling nice.  Recommended.",5
Great polish remover.  I used it to remove three coats of polish and it took it off with one swipe.  Recommended,5
Very handy and work great.  Took these on vacation recently and it was great to not need to take the bottle and worry about leakage.  Usually one pad will do all your nails but sometimes it takes a couple.  Recommended,5
"I have shorter hair and this worked really well for me,  I honestly wasn’t expecting that it was going to work in my shorter hair as the Barrel seems large but to the contrary it does a fabulous job.  Recommended",4
Good primer.  It sprays on and feels a little sticky for about thirty seconds but then dries and feels smooth on your face.  Makeup goes on great and stays on really well.  Wish it had an SPF.  Recommended.,5
"Nice nail kit, very thorough on the selection of accessories.  Works great.",5
"This stuff is amazing!  I didn't even know such a product existed and was excited to try it when I found it.  My baby shih tzu has a top knot that's in the awkward stage where most will stay in a band or clip but the lower pieces fall down into her eyes.<br /><br />I applied a bit of this and all the hair is staying put, LOVE THIS SO MICH!  This tub will probably last me awhile but when it's gone I will be back to buy more.",5
"My hair is long and very fine/slippery, so I generally find that jaw clips are too small to hold all of my hair, too large/weak to keep my hair from slipping loose, and/or too heavy and fall off off my head under its own weight. These clips address all issues fabulously: the long but narrow shape captures all of my hair but clamps it closely enough that the strands don’t slip free and the lightweight nature means that gravity won't pull the clip loose. I can use these clips for both a full bun (I do need to double my long hair over to fit in the clip) or a half-up style.<br /><br />I do object to calling the shade of these “wine red” when the product picture is plainly some kind of magenta shade. The actual clips are darker and mauvier than pictured and certainly pretty, but a far cry from “wine red” still.",5
"I don't find the dry shampoo powder itself to be much better than plain cornstarch or arrowroot flour, especially as a product for blondes. But, the squeeze top dispenser is excellent. I would not repurchase this, but plan to reuse the container for DIY powder dry shampoo.<br /><br />Speaking as someone with black hair who did not realize this product was for blondes when ordering, this product had more of a white cast than most dry shampoos but it wasn't a huge issue---it largely blended away once worked in thoroughly as per usual. Last I checked, the version for brunettes was more expensive, which seems ridiculous.",3
"This is a beautiful foundation. I tried applying this both with a flocked powder puff and a foundation brush. I did prefer the powder puff, which did a better job of picking up the powder through the elasticated net dispenser. The finish is what I would call a ""luminous matte"" or ""lit from within""---it definitely wasn't flat but didn't look dewy or greasy, either. It applied very smoothly over some very textured spots on my skin and covered blemishes well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the shade range sucks. I typically need a shade described as ""very fair"", which are harder to find in mineral foundations. The 100 Light shade is too dark for me unless I also cover my whole neck and chest with it, but the finish is beautiful and I honestly would wear it out on days I'm wear a scarf, for example. I would describe this shade as fair-light or light with a neutral peach undertone.<br /><br />If you are familiar with the Tarte loose powder foundation, this seems very similar but without the clay that tends to oxidize. They have the same style of packaging (elasticated net + stopper lid), same luminous matte finish, and similar longevity.",4
"These are very sturdy bottles with a smooth pump mechanism. I saw no leaking when I used these to fly with shampoo and conditioner recently.<br /><br />Each pump is fairly small and consistent, which makes it very easy to regulate the amount used. I think I will be using these regularly and not just for travel for items without a pump or where the pumps are very inconsistent, like body lotion.",5
"Such as beautiful shade! I really like that the Cheek Pop formula can be applied very sheerly, which means that I, as a very pale person, can wear deeper blush shades like Cola Pop. I still need to be very careful to use a light hand with application, though. Also, the Cheek Pop formula is talc-free!",5
Great deal for the price. Not that easy to clean. But for the price I will order more and toss these out.,4
"These aren't pads to clean make-up off your face(at least not fully), like I thought they were. They're actually supposed to be used after washing your face. After wiping your face with them, you're supposed to press any excess liquid onto your skin and then leave it. I found them a little too harsh for my skin. On the front of the container, it says they're soothing, but I didn't get that at all. My face feels scratched and irritated after I use them and I for sure don't like the feeling of leaving the liquid on my face. It's an itchy feeling and it makes me anxious, as opposed to soothed. I ended up having to wash it off after each time I gave them a try. I like the idea of them, but unfortunately, they're not for me.",3
"My children don't like haircuts, but my 6 year old has an especially hard time with it. While these seem mostly targeted to babies, I decided to give them a try for my older children. These clippers helped the process and all of my children preferred them. That said, these do work better on thinner hair. My two older children have thick hair and these clippers struggled with it. I ended up using another pair of clippers to thin their hair out a bit before swapping back to these. I didn't mention trying new clippers or explain the swapping back and forth, but they still requested I go back to these. These clippers do still make noise when in use, but it is more muted than regular clippers.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are great to use on thinner/finer hair, but for thicker hair, just be prepared to thin it out first. Other than that, I've been super pleased with them.",4
"This cream works pretty well and it doesn't take much. It kept my hair from being frizzy and it defined my curls. That said, maybe my hair is too fine for it. It left an odd feeling to my hair(like a layer of residue) and it's super hard to wash out. I like to wash all products out of my hair before going to bed and I didn't like that my hair still felt dirty after washing(even using my best shampoo). Overall, it's not for me. It may be better for thicker hair, though.",3
"The case of this kit looks on the cheap side. It's almost like stained silver. That said, the tools inside work well. They're not my favorite, by any means, but they do the job. It is a nice travel sized kit, so it would work well for small spaces, too. There are quite a few items inside, so it's a little annoying trying to get certain items out. I didn't know what a good bit of them were for, but it still has a place for everything, all within a small-ish, flat case. It has everything I need for my nails(plus more) and doesn't take up much space, so I have to appreciate it for that.",4
"My husband is using this deodorant, and he likes it.<br /><br />He hasn't tested out the 48 hour claim, but I haven't noticed him smelling sweaty at any point. ;)<br /><br />The scent is overwhelming. It's smells a bit like a nice, manly soap.<br /><br />Overall, no complaints.",4
"Love this mascara! High volume, lots of coverage, very dramatic lashes. I really love that this package comes with a small waterproof mascara as well, I don't want to use waterproof daily and I don't want to buy a large one but I love it for beach days in the summer!",5
"These little combs are amazing! Great at combing clumps out of my lashes after I apply mascara. Portable, and easy to clean!",5
My 7 year old loves this as she is still at the age where she can get away with it. Older kids tend to worry more about each other. This box has 74 accessories for your little girls hair all in a divided reusable container. All decently made items just don't leave them with smaller children alone as it would be a hazard.,3
The quality of the sound is more than the price paid. These headphones will give ones that I paid 10 times the price a run for their money. The cord is plenty long for gaming I just used them on ps4 along with virtual gear and the experience was awesome. I love the way they fit and can't hear much else if anything when wearing this product. One thing I love is the mute Microphone option on them it comes in handy. You won't go regret this purchase and the can't beat the price.<br /><br />Note<br />My reviews are honest no matter the product nor the price I paid . If my review helped you in your purchase take a moment and click helpful.,5
Perfect Toiletry bag for traveling. I bought it for traveling and camping trips. The hanging hook worked perfect with everything at your finger tips.,5
"I know this is a cheap travel brush, but it broke IMMEDIATELY. hard to open close, and the brush component separated from the handle. Super annoying. I was trying to find a replacement for the last one that I'd had for about 10 years, but no luck.",1
Easy to assemble and easy to use.,5
"The product helps to keep my hands a little dry, but not NEARLY as much as I thought it would. They still sweat a lot. I've been using it every night for nearly a week and still no progress. I'll start using talc at night and putting on gloves to help out the product, but I have little hope it'll help.<br /><br />If your hands only get a little sweaty, this product may work for you, but I guess my sweaty hands are too much.",3
"Very nice!  Great tiara, especially for the price.",5
Ok pads but too big for my purpose,3
"We like the products, especially Caring but one of the bottle tops opened in shipping and it was a mess.  I didn't lose a large amount of product but had to wash everything off.",4
You will love the mirror but I bet everyone wishes for it to have a larger mirror area. Magnification is great and I wouldnt give the mirror away for nothing. For the price im happy that it has built in battery and microusb port for charging. Definitely recommending this nice mirror with brightness adjustment. Loving it!,5
"If your face is not sensitive, this stuff may work very well for you. I cut the heck out of myself using this, and I prefer a quality cream such as truefitt & hill, trumper, proraso, etc. Those creams all build a richer lather than this shave soap.",3
"The brush does not go through all of your hair. It's as though you are only brushing the top layer of your hair with this. My hair is not especially thick and it's very fine, so it's unreasonable that this brush would behave this way. I need to give it away, or just throw it away.",2
"This is a simple design-like a rubber belt with small bumps on one side and smaller but denser raised rubber pieces on the other.  Light weight and pliable and easy to use on all parts of the body.  Whether the smaller pieces fall off under use remains to be seen.  My one issue was with shipping.  Took much longer to receive, which is rare for Amazon/UPS, but shipping from Vegas to Phoenix area took 2 weeks, going through several states, even on the East coast-poor communication on their end as well.  Like I said, not usual for Amazon.",4
I love these. LOVE. Every single disc is crisp and leaves clean designs.,5
"The bag is actually very cute and convenient. It protects the brushes and gives me extra storage for my makeup supplies, which is always a plus. The brushes were much, much softer than I expected. Not to mention this was a great discounted price for a brush set.<br /><br />My only issue would be when I opened the package it smelled extremely strong, like being smacked in the face with a bunch of Sharpies. I had to let it air out for a day or two for the smell to go away.",4
"Wow does this work well. So glad I bought it. Easy to apply, results are a miracle.",5
I bought this to try it because I didn’t wanna buy the bigger bottle until I knew that I liked it. Smells amazing!! Hints of pear and vanilla and it lasts a long time. I’ve gotten lots of compliments.,5
"It’s replaced a portion of my gum chewing while driving in the car, and I’ve noticed a slight tone difference with my jawline.",4
I really like these wipes but the packaging is frustrating. It’s hard to not pull out a clump if them that have to be squeezed through the opening.<br /><br />It would so much better if the plastic top was made of recyclable plastic!,3
Love it. Couldn't get it to work on half my fingers but I think I didn't cure the no wipe top coat long enough. I'll keep practicing though.,5
"It smells great, and makes my hands feel softer than any other hand soap I've used.  Really good product.  I ordered a couple of extra bottles in case it becomes difficult to find.",5
"Works well enough, it doesn't allow it to be really tight, over tightening causes it to pop off the listerine bottle.  Definitely, keeps the counter clean and helps control the amount required for proper usage without waste!",3
I did not receive the kit as promised and received the Hydrating Mineral Veil along with a different brush.  So far I love the mineral veil.  It goes on smooth and makes my face feel soft.  It really does appear to hydrate my face but I have only been using this for a few days.  I wish I would have received the brush that was supposed to come with the kit.  I was going to return it but the seller agreed to let me keep both products and refunded my money in full including shipping.  I was going to purchase the brush separately but it is $30.  I will wait until I find it discounted.  The Flawless Application Brush works but I would like to see if the softer brush works better.,5
"I love this case! If you have lots of makeup and want it to be organized and safe while traveling this case is perfect. It’s a good size with adjustable dividers. Very sturdy with nice pockets. All of my makeup and face care fit with room to spare, and there was a lot because I was going to a wedding! The mirror is not worth anything, but I didn’t buy it for a mirror. It’s total worth the price and such a better way to store makeup. I hated having multiple makeup bags where I count see what was in there.",5
No issues yet.,5
Beautiful nail polish color,5
Great smell,5
Can tell a difference,5
"I HATE wax, so I started trying hair products a few years ago. Most didn't work for me until I found the ""GROOM"" Styling Fiber. I semi-panicked when I couldn't find it anymore, even online. I found one barber online who recommended trying this Fix Your Lid High Hold. I bought a container at Target and tried it today. It works perfectly - as good (if not better) than GROOM! Next time I will buy it on Amazon and save $2. If you, like me, are not a fan of wax, give this a shot. [NOTE: I do have very thin, soft hair, so I don't know how this would work for someone with a really coarse hair mustache.]",5
Fabulous make up remover. Excellent size as many other brands are too small.  I have sensitive skin and this remover works well with no irritation. Love this product!,5
"EDIT: the seller contacted me and gave me the replacement. Even though I don't like the quality, at least the seller is responsible.<br /><br /> I throw it away because almost every facial mask has dirty dust on it after I added water to it. Bad quality control. If you don't want your face has some unknown dust or something, then don't risk it.",3
"These are great ~ simple to use, and make your face glow. Can't prove all the hype, but I can say these are the same as the ones 2x and 3x as much.",4
"I love this stuff.  Picked some up at the &#34;red circle&#34; store on sale to try it out.  Much better than the L-----l product and doesn't have that cheap perfume smell.  I have ash blond very curly hair (gradually graying) and it looks better than it ever has. After the cowash, I always apply about 1-2 tsp of any  heavy conditioner and leave it in my hair.  Wish I had found out about the cowash option years ago.  I find products for African American hair work very well for me.  This product is so reasonable and I plan to try some of the other Pantene products in this line as soon as I use my old stuff up.",5
The chemical odor from this wig drove my dogs out of the room after opening it! I had to throw packing in the outside garbage as we where overwhelmed by this odor. Even after 3 washes and leaving wig outside to air out an odor remained. No need to mention the shedding. ..,1
"Gotta take a moment to write a review because this is my favorite soap.  The other kind they make (the non-exfoliating kind) went through phases - first it was exfoliating, then they got bad reviews because it was TOO exfoliating (which I absolutely loved about it), then they removed ALL of the exfoliation and got bad reviews because there wasn't any exfoliation any more... and finally they got it together to have two varieties, one without any exfoliation, and one with exfoliation - this one.  And the other one is now stuck with a 3 star review average just because of that mix-up.<br /><br />At first I was nervous that even with the exfoliation back (this one), it would not be as good as it was before when it had the exfoliation originally, because it used to be oatmeal for the exfoliation, and now it is coffee grounds.  I even sent them a note asking why they didn't use oatmeal any more, and they said it was because the oatmeal version would fall apart in the Amazon warehouses.  But I tried the coffee ground exfoliation - and even though it isn't quite as good - it's still great.  This soap beats any other I've tried to purchase, and I have purchased about 10 brands through Amazon that all said they were exfoliating.  Only one of them was exfoliating enough, and I like this one better.  (I forget the name of that other brand right now; I'm at my computer.  If someone really wants to know, add a comment and I'll dig it up.)  I really need a very strong exfoliating soap, and this one actually is strong enough.  It also happens to be a brown bar with a decent hearty soap material, as well - not phony - so it is all I need.<br /><br />Just wanted to post this review to start to bring back some 5 stars for this company now that they've gotten things sorted out and have two varieties, one exfoliating and one that isn't.",5
"*** UPDATE Nov 9 2015 ***<br />They have now added the exfoliating version back, in another listing.  That means people who love this soap for whatever other reasons without the exfoliation can give it 5 stars for that.  People like me, who can't find strong exfoliating soap from any other brand (I have specifically ordered at least 10 other brands, Loofah, etc. etc. just trying to find one with strong exfoliation - and none have it, except maybe Tasmanian (http://amzn.com/B00CQOHOXY (but this is better)), can now use Honest For Men again - their exfoliating line.  So not this listing, but the other listing.  Not that exfoliating soap should matter, but actually, I'd be scrubbing with rocks from brooks if humans lived out in nature.<br /><br />*** Original review a few days before ***<br /><br />This was my favorite soap - and I depended on it for the fantastic exfoliation, better than any other I've tried (and I tried a dozen kinds).<br /><br />All of a sudden, in this last batch, they have simply removed the exfoliation completely.  Now, when you look at the website, it says &#34;Important Information: We have recently removed our exfoliating oats and coffee grounds due to customer feedback. Our scent is now 100% essential oils no fragrance oil.&#34;<br /><br />Well, I'm here to give you a 1 star review for this &#34;important information&#34;.  There are 1,000 other soaps that you can buy with various interesting scents, etc.  But this was the only soap you can buy that had great exfoliation.<br /><br />And now they've removed it.<br /><br />Hopefully, the 'customer feedback' that caused them to remove the exfoliation will be blasted away by the customer feedback complaining that the exfoliation is missing, and they'll put it back.<br /><br />In the meantime - goodbye, 'Honest for Men'.",5
"A lot of the reviews said that the brush heads didn't spin properly on their clarisonic, but I didn't have that problem. It worked fine, though I wish the bristles were longer. I have some version of Mia from 5+ years ago.",5
Very handy wipes to keep in the bathroom.  I found the shea butter to be very soothing.,5
"Nice soap. I've used it as intended (rub on and face lather), and I've bowl lathered. It works well either way.<br /><br />I actually enjoy the scent. Performance is great. Sure, it dries my skin, but it's soap. Use some balm or moisturizer and off you go.<br /><br />It's too bad 1 stick is almost $5. Buying 3 gets you a much better deal, but i wouldn't buy 3 unless you already know you like it.",5
I followed a guide to make huge bubbles and this worked perfect as an ingredient.,5
"I've been trying to get better about regularly going to a salon for a hair cut. For years I just went to Great Clips once a year. Basically, I'd go whenever I hated my hair so I'd have to chop inches off of split ends. But now I have a salon and a hair stylist I love so I'm trying to go every 3 or so months. My stylist recommended that I start using a hair diffuser whenever I dry my hair because I have naturally curly hair.<br /><br />I don't use heat on my hair often but when I do, I've been attaching this to my hair dryer. I have the Infiniti Pro by Conair 1875 Watt Full Size Salon Performance AC Motor Styler/Hair Dryer (that I also bought from Amazon) and this fits on it perfectly. I read reviews that sometimes this hair diffuser doesn't work on all hair dryers because the diameter is smaller or larger than what this is compatible. But I measured the diameter of my hair dryer so I knew it would work. And I love how my hair reacts to being diffused. My curls just look marvelous. I almost wish I had time to blow dry my hair every day - almost.<br /><br />I love how it's collapsible so it doesn't take up too much space under my sink. I definitely recommend this product if you're looking for a diffuser.",5
Good weight and the ridges in the bottom seem to help with lathering.,5
"Good for reducing static which is a nuisance in the dry season.. Really easy on my hair.  Bought it for my wife, who kept stealing my brush- now I find myself stealing hers.. Looks nice too.",5
"This is my first horsehair brush. Immediately, I liked it as the more compact size makes my soap last forever.. It's the perfect amount of lather for two to three passes. And the brush itself lathers extraordinarily well in a bowl, though it is softer than boar on the face- best badger or softer! BUT.. I recommend getting some tutelage on a forum or youtube about care of horsehair brushes- Being a bit of a masher (my old boar brushes are pretty splayed), I wound up with a bit of a birdsnest in the center of the brush which i had to detangle. I was immediately disappointed and shelved it- I was going to try and sell it. But the few great shaves I had made me want to try to use it right and now, with less pressure (ease up if it feels scratchy at all) and slightly different motions (figure 8s instead of circles, incidentally) I get great lather (using tabac) and the brush doesn't tangle- and it's even smoother and softer on the face. I'm so glad I took a little care to figure this fantastic brush out.",5
"After having used this product for a month, I find myself hooked.  As YMMV when taking someone's word on shave gear, I thought I might provide some background about me:  I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  I learned to shave with a gillette adjustable years ago(which I still use), but out of &#34;convenience&#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow) I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I'm feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness- I use personna lab blue blades or sharper in it).  I've tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  Mitchell's is excellent.  It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  It lathers up easily-  I've used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush.. In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  I'm not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush and it is good to go.  I've heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can't really comment on that.  But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  Amazing even..  I dreamt wetshaving was like this as a teenager..<br />  One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) and reticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review but it's been a month, and the puck looks basically the same size!  Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  I'm guessing this one will last me three months or more.. So at that rate, the price basically factors out altogether.<br />  To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren't looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  One word:  I wouldn't spring for the dish because I am cheap.  You might not be.. But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering.. Probably not a mug though, unless it were seriously oversized..",5
title says it all.,5
I've tried many different types of shave soap. This is by far the best I've every used. There's a reason it get so many good reviews.,5
"After reading the reviews about nail bed damage and how well this helps the soak off I ended up getting it.<br /><br />Firstly, it does peel a little nail bed up, so the damage thing is accurate. I wouldn't suggest using it &#34;as advertised&#34;. However, after nudging off one nail I dis the standard coarse board, polish remover soaked cotton balls, wrap my fingers in foil thing. The soak off is MUCH easier with this as the base coat. They come off faster, more cleanly and leave behind no damage.<br /><br />I'm only giving it three stars for a few reasons. It doesn't do what it says it should do. It does lift. On my second try, after the first experiment, I did my nails again. Several nails lifted and peeled. Some came completely free with no damage. Usually my gels outlast my level of interest, and I soak them off before I even go the full two weeks. These definitely have a gripping problem. That's not a negative for me. It makes polish changes easier. However, it mean that they don't do what they're supposed to do.<br /><br />Bottom line, the things about this product that make it convenient for me are counter to what the product is advertised as doing. I imagine that would make it a poor buy for many a gel lover.",3
"These are my favorite facial wash clothes. The only ones I use. Absorbent but soft. Good looking, too.",5
"This is an excellent portable paraffin wax treatment. I really love how it makes my hands feel really silky and smooth. I can't really do anything when these are on my hands, but they feel nice and I like relaxing with them. Also, the black heart on the outside actually turns red when the wax gets really hot. I used mine in the microwave, and it worked really well.<br /><br />They have a unique design, which is basically a plastic hand wrapper that has a spongy interior, and the sponge holds all of the paraffin wax so that it delivers it right to your hands. It also stays hot for a pretty long time, which surprised me that all the heat didn't dissipate really quickly.<br /><br />These are made for average hands, so if your hands are giant, then these might be hard to fit into. But, they should work pretty well for most hands. Also, they're great for the first treatment, but for subsequent treatments, it's really tough to keep the wax in the sleeve while microwaving.<br /><br />But, overall, they're awesome for disposable paraffin treatments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Makes your hands feel silky smooth<br />+The spongy interior absorbs and holds most of the wax<br />+The heat indicator really works<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May not last a full five treatments<br /><br />*TGN gave me this wax to review*",5
"My son loves this tooth brush!! I asked my hygienist what she thought of this kind of brush and she said go for it! Whatever makes kids brush their teeth! Lol. I read online that this kind isn't good for adults because it doesn't reach the top of their teeth, but it does reach for kids.",5
"These eyelash curler replacement pads are a tad short for the Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler, but do a great job. The seller was quick to respond to my questions and honest about the slight difference in length.<br />Shu Uemura is my go to curler, but does not sell replacement pads. You have to purchase another one of their curlers when two included pads wear out. These by Shiseido are great and reasonably priced.",5
"I tried a friends first and loved it.  This works better than any other concealer I've used.  It's pretty expensive, but lasts a long time.  I don't just use it to cover up &#34;boo-boos&#34; but use it all the time. I highly recommend it.",5
None of the brushes are narrow in the gaps of their teeth. Good if you're looking for brush with wider gaps between the teeth.,2
Fantastic. I kind of want to stock up on these they work so well. They do a tight hold and articulate so that you can hold big bunches of hair.,5
This hand soap smells great! (Beach foaming shea butter) rinses off easily and is soft on the skin (not drying).,5
I really hoped this would work but it didn't. I guess it is not for everyone... I didn't see any result after using out the whole bottle.,2
"They sell this as having a ton of functions, the Swiss tool of the shaver world even. It does have a lot of attachments and they are all pretty good quality, but the shavers are bad. The beard and head shaver don’t have the gear reduction to move fast and hard enough to have a smooth shave. The rest however are fantastic. I especially love the cleanser brush. It feel fantastic on my head after a fresh shave.",4
"Update: still in good shape after over 3 years of daily use. The areas with mesh have little holes from the items in the bag but that's to be expected.<br />I got a good one, no smell like others complained of. Perfect size for a man's gym bag when you only have a few products you want to keep organized.",5
"They are very comfortable except that they are very large for an average woman's face. Perfect for my larger husband. If you're actually looking for protection, these are not for you but I don't think they claim to be for anything other than 'fashion'. I would love them to be a bit thicker and smaller.",4
Best brow pencil ever.,5
Very nice soap. Good lather.,5
Pros: Pleasant smell that disappears quickly- it’s noticeably different from regular polishes. Dries fast into an almost gel-like coating. Peels off easily without damaging the nail. Colors are all very beautiful. Nice for my elementary aged daughter who wants her nails done but ends up picking them off anyway.<br />Cons: only lasts a day or two- if you plan to wash dishes or wash your hands a lot the polish will start lifting off at the edges. The colors are different than the pack I ordered and when I looked back I couldn’t find a pack that actually included the colors sent to me. I ended up liking the colors I was given though so it wasn’t too bothersome. Some of the polishes are thicker than I’d like but still usable.,4
They’re great and look good enough to wear anywhere--not just for grooming.,5
I had been looking at different shampoos – and must have put the size of a different shampoo with the features of this shampoo. Although it is nice – this is a very extravagant price. It's completely my fault for not noticing the size before hitting the buy button.,2
"This is the 2nd set of TJoe's lotion I've ordered at Amazon. Sometimes I pick these up at Trader Joes, but it's just way more convenient to shop online these days. I had no issues at all with the first pair of lotions, but just a heads-up here: the 2nd set arrived oozing lotion. Turns out both dispenser pumps were BUSTED. Augh! Luckily, I still had the pumps from both of my old bottles, so I just transferred them into the new ones. But .... NO idea how the plastic pumps literally broke! They don't even touch each other when shrink wrapped together! Maybe it was the change in pressure as I live a mile high?<br /><br />I DO love the consistency and longevity of the lotion, so that's what counts here. Great value for the money ... but if you have a pump on-hand already, DO NOT throw it away till you ensure the new ones aren't BUSTED.",3
"It's been a great nail file thus far. It seems gentler than the metal files I've used in the past but I miss having the fine-point pick of the metal files. You cannot pick under your nails with this, just file them.",4
"I was incredibly excited to try this product, however after about 6 weeks of using it daily my complexion has not approved at all. It also has a smell that makes me nauseous.",2
"When this first arrived, I was disappointed by the EXTREMELY small size of this deodorant, but when I tried it I loved it (great smell of beeswax and cocoa butter) and I realized it was the perfect size for traveling, camping and backpacking! I also love the fact that the ingredients are all natural. I've tried many natural deodorants in the past and was very unhappy with all of them.",5
"There is no scent that can compare with this Oro Gold Body Butter, in Devotion.  It is sensational and this is my second jar. It is rich ,  creamy and makes your skin feel like satin. Love it!!",5
I’m constantly looking for a shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft and alive. This set is the best I’ve come to it.,5
"These are the first extensions I've ever owned.  I've worn them twice now -- and overall, I'm enjoying them.  The bleached blond streaks are very bleached -- too much so for my hair color (dark blond), so I plan to darken these streaks with a darker hair color.  We'll see how that works :-)  I wish I'd gotten the more solid, dark blond or light brown.  I purchased the 18&#34; extensions based on other reviews that said they are very thin at the bottom -- I wanted more thickness to my hair, not more length (although I would have been open to additional length if that worked out) and I wanted enough length that I could trim them, if needed.  I'm glad I did this -- I was able to cut off about 2&#34; of very wispy ends to match my own hair length.  When I clipped them in before cutting them to length, the wispy ends looked obvious and weird where they extended beyond my own hair length because there just wasn't enough hair at the ends to look right.  In any case, when I cut them to match my own hair length, they did exactly what I wanted -- I ended up with a nice thick braid.  These extensions are totally straight -- to achieve the look of the woman in the photo with wavy hair, you'd need to use a curling iron or curlers to add that wave.",4
These are garbage since they will only fit a child's size head.  The minute your try to expand them the elastic rips out.  I am returning them,1
"The men in my family loved using it. A few never used<br />I bought multiple blades for the guys to each have their own<br />It was fun to have a shaving station at our family gathering.<br />Using this, gives a closer shave then more expensive multi blade shavers",5
just as expeceted,5
Perfect.  They work well and have a nice range of colors.,5
Works great for my granddaughters very thick long black hair!!!,5
works great for my granddaughters-long black hair!!!,5
Nice vase for owls lovers. Nicely crafted. Has a nice heft to it so it doesn't tip over. Well packaged for shipment. I love the detail of the owl!,5
"Because of my training I have some knowledge of skin care and this is the best antioxidant treatment serum I have found. It leaves my soon-to-be-50 skin looking great. The ingrdients are exactly the same and in the same amounts as the other spa product but this one costs less than half! It is a light weight, fast asorbing serum with no fragrence to irritate sensitive skin. I use it before applying the hydrating gel. Can be used alone or worn under make up. Make-up application simply glides on almost like using a primer. I use this (along with the hydrating gel) twice a day, in the morning after my shower while my pores are still open and before bed after washing my face with a gentle non-soap cleanser. The only additional product I need is a good facial moisturizer with sunscreen under my make-up. Do yourself a favor and try this if you are looking for a great anti aging skin care treatment to reverse old damage AND to prevent new damage.",5
I don’t like to use these as recommended but I do love using them for teasing while doing a balayage!!!,5
Very nice product. Just like described you can create multi individual strokes that look just like real eyebrow hairs. Very natural and easy to use!!,5
Weird layer over closer. Cannot bleach the notes and customize.,1
I prefer a strip lash. It doesn’t take as much time to put on.,3
"This is exactly the same cleaner that was packed with my shaver. The only difference is the writing on the packets is entirely in Japanese. Having read the English version that was packed with my new shaver, I doubt if there is anything new to read on these. Just empty the contents into the tank and fill to the line with clean water. Easy.",5
These were really cute. 2 of my clips were broken ( hearts came off clip ) but a lil glue will fix that.,3
Good quality and good stretch,5
Advertised as gel polish remover - doesn't do a think to gel,1
Great for lower back pain. But I add extra 2 tblsp of liquid dmso to this product.,4
I was hesitant to order this because my past experience with holo powders is that they flake off after a few days but this one doesn't. And I love that I can get different effects based on how I apply it.,5
"Loved lotion and easy and small enough to carry around, granddaughter loves the size and smell",5
I bought two kits a same time. Easy to use.,5
"I bought this product along with the coochy cream shave system (I still laugh saying the name!). I used to wax and was aware of the sales pitches of &#34;serums&#34; that helped with ingrown hairs. I don't know if they made a difference for me, but when it came to this product I figured I was either going to buy the entire system or nothing at all.<br /><br />I'm glad I did!<br /><br />This product is used AFTER shaving! I was nervous about spraying on a freshly shaved...area (LOL), but it did not sting or cause discomfort. As a matter of fact, it made my skin even smoother and made my clothes glide over that area like silk!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend!",5
I was very pleased to have bought this product. It is made of good quality. It arrived as promised. It was well packed. It is a Christmas present and I was glad to see there were no dents or damage. It is a very nice case with ample space for your cosmetics and other accessories. I think it will make my daughter will be very happy. Thanks!,5
great item! works well!,5
"My brush ends don't look like what is in the picture BUT I think it's actually better. The lip brush end looks like the flat brush tip in the picture but the other end is like a short rounded eyeshadow brush tip. For me, I am using the one side as a lip brush to smooth out my lip liner and the other end I will use for concealer touchups on the go. Also, the description says both ends are retractable but only the lip brush side is. I do like the mechanics of it - you just pull up and the brush pops out. I really really wish the other end had been retractable too as bigger brush tips are a pain in the neck to recap. But the brush works great, it makes my liner razer sharp smooth and it's convenient to carry so I'm happy.",4
Love this color and it’s smooth application,5
I totally worth the money. I get lots of compliments whenever I wear this at work. Super cute super comfy .,5
Works great!,5
These work great for my small travel size eyeshadow.,5
"These work great. So far I've only used them for misting my plants with water, which is what I got them for in the first place. They work flawlessly for that. So often I get spray bottles that simply don't work or the spray comes out all wonky. These bottles are perfect for what I use them for.",5
"Do you see “100% Natural” and think “Yeah, right!” or do you assume it won’t work as well as products that have chemicals? I do this all the time especially when it comes to cleaning products or makeup. In this case I was offered a bottle of Pure Body Naturals™ 100% Natural Nail Polish Remover and the skeptical part of me was sure this wouldn’t turn out well. But in the spirit of trying new things, I agreed to review it and put it to the test.  **See the images for before/after photos**<br /><br />For my test I painted my nails several different colors. We all know deep reds are harder to get off and glitters can also be a pain to remove. I dedicated my left hand to the Pure Body Naturals™ 100% Natural Nail Polish Remover and my right hand I used a drugstore brand of acetone polish remover (the super cheap stuff I usually use.)  Both hands got two good coats of polish.<br /><br />To remove the polish the Pure Body Naturals™ remover instructions say to drop or dab it on and wait 2-3 minutes before wiping. For the generic acetone remover I just apply and wipe with a cotton ball.<br /><br />The Pure Body Naturals™ remover wiped right off, taking most of the polish with it. I did have to reapply a small amount, wait a few more minutes and all but one tiny trace of the red polish was gone.  The acetone remover left polish near my cuticles even after a hard scrubbing and a second try.<br /><br />So what did I like?<br />-I like that it works better than the acetone remover, even on the darkest red and glitter!<br />-I like that it did not make my nails feel dry.<br />-I like that the Pure Body Naturals™ remover doesn’t have harsh chemicals.<br />-I like that it isn’t tested on animals.<br />-I like that it comes with a handy glass dropper.<br /><br />The only problem (and it could have been a BIG one) is this polish will eat through any polish, including vanish on my dining room table and styrofoam plates. No kidding. I started out thinking to drip the remover over a plate to keep it off the table but it quickly melted the styrofoam and one small spot of the table varnish.<br /><br />Only use this stuff in the bathroom over tile or a sink with no finish/paint/lacquer, etc. never over a delicate surface like your dining room table!<br /><br />I received a free sample of this remover to review.  I have given my honest opinion and the real test/comparison results.",4
My first electric toothbrush.  Works fine although I still think a regular toothbrush works just as good.  Lasts at least a week on a single charge (although now I just leave it plugged in and charged all the time).  Can't beat the price.,5
"The gene pool I come from has Viking, German, and Irish heritage -- resulting in a stiff wiry beard that defeats most cordless beard trimmers.  To give this trimmer a good chance I followed the directions and charged it for the two hours as recommended in the instructions.  My only gripe about this process is that you're supposed to keep an eye on it so that when charging is finished you can disconnect it immediately to avoid potential damage.  Since the unit has no automatic shut-off when charging is completed, you have to keep an eye on it to avoid a problem.  That is my only gripe about this unit.  Not too many people have the time flexibility to watch it for the two hours (or less) it needs to charge.<br /><br />While it only comes with 3 attachments that is all you really need.  The shaver itself is large enough to give you a firm grip and the weight implies quality.  The initial effort at trimming my beard was highly successful.  I grew it for two weeks to make it a challenge and then shaved it without using any attachments.  Normally (with other units) I would have expected difficulty in shaving it flush with my skin. Typically this type of trimmer is not powerful enough to plow through my beard, pulls some hair out instead of cutting it, and sometimes nicks my skin.  None of that happened here.  Evidently the battery and the motor are up to the task.<br /><br />This is by far the best cordless trimmer I have ever owned and used.  Highly recommended!",5

I love these extensions! They look just like they do in the picture! Very long and soft,5
"Mine came very thin and there wasn’t much hair left on the bottom half. I am returning it, I believe that it was just the set I got that was possibly used by someone else before me.",2
"This was my first experience with an ice roller so I didn't know what to expect.  It seems larger than it should be, my teenage daughter says it is the right size, ha!  Anyway, it feels great to roll on my face and I have been using it also on sore muscles after a workout.  I have not noticed any physical changes from it but it is soothing so I will keep using it.  Looking forward to those hot summer days to give it a try for cooling off",5
"I was happy to find One with Nature soaps on Amazon since the big natural food store no longer carries this brand.  Price was right, shipping was fast and the price was a bit cheaper than what I had been paying at the big natural food store too.  These soaps don't dry out my skin, especially important in the winter months when my eczema tends to flare up.  The orange scent is pleasant and natural smelling",5
"Nice large size, it can really fit a lot. It feels of good quality. However, it has the horrendous smell that almost counteracts the good aspects.",3
Best lip balm on the planet!,5
Waves make people sea sick from looking at my head.,5
"I bought Shiadora's organic argan oil and have been using it now for about a week. Yes, it moisturizes my hair and skin very well as they claim it would. It absorbes well and makes my hair and skin glow without being heavy. The scent is very light and pleasant as well.<br /><br />This is my first experience with purchasing argan oil after months of researching various companies and I did well! :-) The seller was great as it arrived early and in perfect condition.<br /><br />I want to see how well it will help with regrowing my hair as I use it in conjunction with certain vitamins and a certain shampoo and conditioner...alopecia issues. I will continue to use this product for what it has already proven to accomplish and I highly recommend it.",5
It made her happy!,5
Perfect bandannas for when im out doing outdoorsy stuff.,5
"This palette wouldn't have been bad for the price, but the shadows didn't have hardly any pigmentation to them. I have used it several times now, both on and off camera, and I think these colors are alright for a light wash of color just not for anything major.",2
"I am very pleased with these. The bristles feel satisfying and do a really good job cleaning my teeth. The colors are handy to keep track of which toothbrush is yours. I was not expecting to like bamboo toothbrushes so much - I thought I would make a sacrifice for the environment, but I actually like them better than the expensive plastic ones we used in the past. I hope they keep making them exactly like this.",5
"Even being shipped from overseas, it arrived in prime condition and was very high quality.  Got it for a friend going into the ministry and he was delighted!",5
This shampoo & condtioner work great & smell great! My hair is left soft and manageable! I have a ton of long hair and I was not left with a head full of snarles which happens sometimes with other products!,5
I am a true believer in this lotion and I can only find it online. I have been using it for years. My sister in law truly believes using this every day kept her from having stretch marks,5
They work but not reasonably priced for what you are recieving,3
Many options but they don’t form well to the nail. They don’t stay on.,2
"Beautiful, eye catching.  Purchased as a gift.",5
"I honestly feel that Shea Moisture Hemp Seed Oil Length Conditioner and its matching shampoo have definitely improved my hair growth and thickness following Chemotherapy. My hair has always been slow growing, so a few inches after a year is fast for me though YMMV. I find the conditioner is nourishing, without being too heavy or allowing fly-aways. Less is more with this conditioner as well, as a bottle lasted me a year, but I was bald to start; again, YMMV.<br />This three-pack was definitely an excellent value for the money, especially with Prime shipping.",5
"I developed acne on my back after my daughter was born, and this is the only soap that calms and soothes the breakouts without drying my skin. It has an almost unnoticeable light scent, even my extremely scent sensitive mother likes it. I stopped purchasing it when a tavern was built next to my local health food store making parking on the weekends impossible. This was a huge mistake because other soaps were either too drying or encouraged more breakouts.<br />It is so nice to find this soap on Amazon, as it saves me the inconvenience of trying to navigate my crowded local health food store on a Sunday. It arrived nicely packed, undamaged and as a bonus, the twelve pack came with a lovely wood soap dish unmentioned in the description; though it is shown in the pictures.",5
Great deal! I bought the 3 pack of Goody spin pins for the same amount that I got 120 pins here! I'm so excited to have them.  I have used the pins on my daughters and myself and they work perfectly. Put my little girl's hair in a high bun for school (expecting her to come home looking disheveled) and it lasted the whole day!,5
Cheaper than name brand and works just as well.,5
Great so far.,5
Clamps work well to help me separate my hair for styling.,4
"This styling wax is so-so. It helps to spike my hair, but it also is a little too difficult to use.",3
"There's something about this conditioner that just works for me.  Before this, I've never, ever found a conditioner I like.  Most of them leave my hair heavy;  many of them leave my hair feeling a bit stiff or crunchy.  Often they make my scalp itch as well.  Funny, my hair/scalp isn't as sensitive to shampoos as it is to conditioners.  This shampoo, however, leaves my hair feeling softer/smoother but not weighed down at all.  Actually, when you're rinsing it out, you can still feel that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling; not that greasy feeling you get with other conditioners.  But, it does soften/moisturize the hair.  It's soothing to the scalp as well.  Scent is pleasant but quite subtle.<br /><br />age:  upper 50's<br />hair:  short;  50% gray; natural<br />climate:  dry & hot<br />use of hair product:  minimal<br />use of (heat) styling tools:  no",5
"I love this thing, as well as the toothbrush covers. As someone who travels for work, it's nice to have found such quality and inexpensive products for my toiletries!",5
"I'm not well versed in extensions and the like, but thought this was a great idea to change things up every once in a while. The hair itself is beautiful. No shedding issues, no unusual tangling and no weird smells. I was able to straighten if I wanted to and once washed, it went back to it's beautiful natural texture.<br />My only issue with this is the net is huge and I had issues with how to apply it without it bulking up. As I said, I'm not the best with these things but it seems that this piece could be a bit smaller. My 2nd issue is that the strip of hair to wrap around to secure is very thin. I've seen others that are thicker w/ more hair, which makes it easy to hide where the fake hair is secured to your actual ponytail. My 3rd issue is the velcro kept getting caught on my real hair. You have to be super careful but since it was a bit difficult to secure because of the huge net, sometimes I was going so slow that the hair would shift and I had to start again. Kind of hard to explain but I think if I could apply this without worrying about pulling my hair out, it would be easier to secure. Anyway, once I got it on it looked great and I'm sure I'll use it here or there. Just some things for potential buyers to be aware of.",3
"I love this so much! Perfect blend of colors for me! I'm blonde, blue eyes and fair skin and some freckles. Love it so much!!",5
"My daughter bought a 1/2 price tiara at a bridal store for $70, there’s very little difference in sizes, quality of the stones and style. This one stands 1/2 an inch taller (better in my opinion for her updo). But the sparkle is there, the silver is realistic, the combs are metal not plastic. It’s an amazing little crown at a tiny price. Simply put... this one will more than suffice for that special day, birthday, prom, wedding, I can’t say for how long it’ll look this beautiful, but for under $10 who cares, it’s going to last long enough for your special day. Especially after you ruin it by getting hair products on it, the expensive one or this one, you won’t feel robbed tossing this one.",5
"Beautiful, stayed on, easy to remove & replace the lashes... but you definitely need makeup remover for the magnetic liner. I had to fight to remove it.",5
"Basic curling iron, it curled my hair nicely, I managed not to burn my fingers or hair. Takes a bit of time to do your whole head as compared to curlers that go in all at once, but I think you get better control with a curling iron because the thickness of hair varies & so does the time needed for curls. Works well heated up fairly quickly, no problems or complaints.",5
Every thing was great. They For both my machine and we worked wonderfully,5
useful product.,5
I find that the mask fits better and my glasses don't get stretched out.  The nose part fits better also.  Thanks.,5
love them  I use them all the time,5
"Add a  pod and water to the dispenser.  Not filling a landfill with more plastic containers, reuse the original dispenser.  Hand cleaner comes out in a foam and is an effective hand cleanser.",5
"I have PCOS and I have a lot of coarse hair on my face and neck. I used the high speed and it pulled thick, stubborn hairs from the root in 1 pass. I didn't have much luck with the facial cap. The low speed is for fine hairs and worked wonders on my upper lip. I didn't try it on my body yet. I'll update this review with that.<br />Pros: it's corded. I don't have to wait for a charge. It has 60 tweezers, trimmer head, sensitive cap, and travel case.<br />Cons: No light, can't wash the heads under water.",5
I had this set in the neutral / browns colors and it was amazing so i decided to order more colors.. these are terrible. half are broken. It hurts to put these on my eyes.,1
Easy to use and curls lashes well.  I don't frequently use eyelash curlers but I'm now a fan of this one.  It curls well and is ergonomic.  It's great to use even if you aren't wearing makeup just to make your eyes pop.  I have used various curlers but this is the classic design done perfectly.,5
Helps for those bad hair days and stylish too!,5
It came and is very pretty but sadly half of it is unraveled. And my knitting skills are not such that I can fix this. In the process of returning item. Curious if they will honor that.  I do like how it looks and if it had been whole I think would have done the job very well but unable to give any further information.,2

Its good as it has no talc or fragrance.,4
Sure makes your face feel great.,5

"My mother loves this product and would purchase it regularly at local stores-then it was no more! She purchased another brand-the ""container"" drives me bananas, makes a HUGE mess-so I asked her ""why didn't she purchase Cashmere powder anymore?"" She explained she couldn't find it anywhere-so this product became a ""stocking stuffer"" surprise along with the Amazon.com/DealsBuzz info. so Mom can still smell like Mom!",5
"I got this to use in the shower to scrub my scalp. I can't get it through my wet hair and my hair is thin. I'm going to try brushing my cat, using it as a sensory thing.",3
Nice piece and good quality.,5
"I ordered this set for the lashes since I already have some liner.  I am very glad I do have the liner because the one that comes with this set is crap.  I made sure my eyes were clean and dry.  I read the directions on the back of the package...<br />shake the liner 10 times (I made sure I shook it more than that), apply a thick layer and let dry a few seconds (it took longer than that)  apply another thick coat then get the lash and apply it to the liner area.  gently press down.<br />Very simple right?  NOPE.  The edges kept lifting up and the lash fell off after a couple of blinks.  OK I thought, maybe my liner wasn't thick enough, so I applied another really good coat and then tried the lash again....Same results.  I then washed my eye again and tried with my other liner and the lash stayed on like it should.<br />I like the lashes very much.  All three pair are a natural length (IF you use mascara), and vary in looks.  If you get these, make sure you have another liner available or plan to purchase one.",3
Very typical and just what I expected and wanted.  Thank you.,4
"I bought these for a kids pool party, was really awesome and fun, and washed right off with soap and water!",5
I really like this set! The quality is good and they work quite well. The curved file is my favorite to use. Definitely worth the price!,5
"Love this product, I received an earlier tube from a promotional box and WOW, the stuff covers well and stays put!  (I use it for undereye coverage not boo boos, although some mornings my eyes look like it)  I will keep this in my cosmetic box forever!  The light is really light, if you're very light skinned it's the perfect color or if you're doing contouring it's perfect.",5
"I have very fine hair and these actually hold it back from my face and do not slip out until I remove them.  My only complaint is that they are somewhat uncomfortable behind the ears, but that could be because I also wear glasses",5
I wasn’t aware that the “magnet” was a substance in the black eyeliner.  I am totally spastic at applying eyeliner and it was made worse by the speed with which this magnetic good dried.  Not for me,1
Not a fan as it is difficult to dispense from the package and just crumbles right to the floor of the shower as you are scrubbing with it.  I think the salt is too coarse but that is only my opinion.  I obviously will not be buying again.,2
Great deal.,5
I crochet sweater shrugs and use the hair sticks for closures instead of buttons. The color match the yarns.,5

"Does what it says, covers all imperfections, color was exactly what I expected.",5
Runs kind of small,3
The electric toothbrush used with this head holds a charge for some time and is quite effective at cleaning plaque off of my teeth. I wear braces and I recommend this head and the professional brand electric toothbrush.,5
"This stuff works, but if you don't reapply it while not in the shower, you will get bumps a few days later. I know it's made to be rinsed off, but that is the only way I have found to keep it from getting bumpy. I would suggest just buying something to put on after you shave to keep the bumps and ingrowns away. My main complaint is that the pumps don't even work! Super annoying.",3
Makes my husband's beard so soft!,5
While the stickers themselves are adorable they are actually pretty slick and don't keep me or my child from sliding around.  The bottom of my tub came with a better non-slip tread than these stickers have.<br /><br />I would recommend these more for decorating the side of the tub rather than using them as a non-slip pad.,3
Just love it. If you have wool clothes/blankets you can safely wash them with it too.,5
Not as good as Bare minerals...color not the same.,3
"I hadn't noticed that this waterpik doesn't pause to keep time for top teeth/bottom teeth. Other than that, it's great. I haven't used the travel one yet but it is definitely compact enough which is a great bonus!",4
"These are my family’s wipes of choice. No perfume, gentle, and very moist. They have been wonderful for our extended camping trips. They have also been on my subscribe & save, but at about 5$, they were a bit expensive. Recently, the price is over 7$ for 25 in a pack. We have switched to a different brand , 90 in pack, with cucumber scent. A better bargain, but allergic reaction within the family is still unknown.",5
"Love this light, it provides enough wattage and works as efficiently as the ones in the salon.",5
"This product feels nice, but I wish it came in a bigger container.",5
These toothbrush heads fit the Sonicare Essence series 1 well. The shape of toothbrush head looks the same as the Philips one that I am currently using. It is soft for cleaning teeth. I got 6 of them in one pack that cost less money than other.,5
Just as expected,5
